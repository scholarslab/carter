<A name="AB1">BAILEY, ARTHUR (d. 1683)</a>, London merchant and  a former ship's captain who had been in Virginia.

<A name ="BT">BRENT TOWN</a> was a speculative land development put together by Nicholas Hayward (d. <I>ante</I> 1697) of London, a notary public, merchant, and speculator. Hayward assembled a syndicate composed of London merchants <A HREF="Cbibl.html#RB">Robert Bristow</A> (1643-1707)  and Richard Foote (his brother-in-law), and George Brent of <q>Woodstock," Stafford County. The syndicate purchased on January 10, 1686/87, from Lord Culpeper, by then the sole owner of the Northern Neck Proprietary, 30,006 acres in Stafford County "Between the Courses of the said Two Rivers, Rappahannock and Potowmack  . . . upon and Between the Southwest and Northeast Branches of Ocaquant Creek. . . ." Hayward obtained a dispensation from King James II that would allow the Hugenots that he hoped to settle on the land to have the "full exercise  of their Religion." The town that Hayward hoped to build on the tract was called Brenton, "but this was corrupted by local [Virginia] usage into Brent Town, and that came to be the designation of the whole tract." Hayward was not successful in persuading Hugenots to move to the lands, and, after flirting with other possibilities, the tract remained unsettled and unsurveyed at the time of his death about 1697. The members of the syndicate and their heirs bequeathed and sold their rights in the Brenton tract for generations. Robert Carter was to have considerable trouble over the tract after becoming agent of the proprietors  again in 1721. He was pressed to grant lands in the area of Brenton, but it was very difficult to do so because the tract had not been surveyed&mdash;and was not to be until 1737-1738.  Fairfax Harrison, in a chapter entitled "Brent Town, Ravensworth and the Hugenots," in his Landmarks of Old Prince William (from which all quotations used here are taken) tells the story of Brent Town  extremely well.  (<A HREF="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison. <I>Landmarks. . . .</I> pp. 177-198.</A> See also <A HREF="Cbibl.html#">Davis,  <i>William Fitzhugh. . . .</i> p. 191, fn 2</A>, and other sources.)<br><br>

<A name="BHQ">BRICK HOUSE QUARTER</name>  was located in Lancaster County roughly three miles northwest of Carter's home. It  was a "collection of parcels acquired . . . from various owners." One of those owners was the family of " Rev. Andrew Jackson, (Irish-Presbyterian) minister of Christ Church Parish from 1686-1710.  His brother James sold Robert Carter some 1,300 acres in 1713, part of which included the Brick House tract.  . . .  [Rev.] Jackson lived in a manor house (the "Brick House") on lands that became part of this Brick House Quarter. . . ."

<A name="RB">BRISTOW, ROBERT</a>  (1643-1707), "emigrated to Virginia about 1660 and established himself in Gloucester County." He became a burgess, and supported the government during Bacon's Rebellion, was captured by the rebels, and lost much property. He is usually referred to as "Major Bristow," probably because of his service at this time. Returning to England in 1677, he became a member of the Grocer's Company, a successful merchant in the Virginia trade, and an alderman of London. His daughter was married to <A HREF="Cbiodir.html#AB2">Arthur Bailey</a>. Bristow was one of the four partners in the <A HREF="Cbiodir.html#BT">Brenton  land</A> speculation in Virginia; see the <A HREF="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/browse-carter?id=C15a01a.xml&images=images/modeng&data=/web/data/users/berkeley&tag=public">letter of January 1, 1715,</A> Hooper to Robert Carter, for more information.

<A name="RB2">BRISTOW, ROBERT (1688-1737)</a>, grandson of Major <A HREF="Cbiodir.html#RB">Robert Bristow</a> ; Robert Carter turned down an opportunity to be his Virginia agent, and, in 1709, Bristow gave a power of attorney to Thomas Booth of York County for that purpose. In 1772, a Thomas Booth was still the Bristow family's agent, but their lands were confiscated during the American Revolution. Bristow was a Member of Parliament for Winchelsea, 1708-1737, and a director of the  Bank of England. (<A HREF="Cbibl.html#A5">Tyler.

<A name="EJ">JENINGS, EDMUND</a>  (1659-1727), at odds with Robert Carter for most of his life. Born in England, he was trained as a lawyer and practiced that profession in Virginia where he was Attorney General and 
Secretary of State as well as a member of the Council and holder of many lesser offices. He succeeded Robert Carter as agent for the proprietors of the Northern Neck in 1711, and, due to his poor health, left the records in a considerable muddle as Robert Carter found upon resuming the agency in 1721. Jenings accrued many debts, especially to London merchant <A HREF="Cbiodir.html#MP">Micajah Perry</a>, and Robert Carter eventually took a mortgage on Jenings' estate, "Ripon Hall," taking it over when Jenings could not make the payments. Because of poor health Jenings was suspended from the Council in 1726 when Lt. Governor <A HREF="Cbiodir.html#HD">Hugh Drysdale</A> was planning a trip to England for his health. Robert Carter thus became first member of the Council, and acting governor upon Drysdale's sudden death on July 22, 1726.

These holdings apparently lay up the Rappahannock near the falls as Carter always sent his sloop for its tobacco.
