</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants Jonathan Mathews and John Goodwin, 1704 May 23, concerning the affairs of the estate of Ralph Wormeley for which he is one of a number of trustees. He notes that a bill of exchange to Dr. John Lomax, husband of Wormeley's daughter Elizabeth, does not appear in the account the merchants have sent, reports the shipment of 32 hogsheads belonging to the estate by two ships, and that he has drawn another bill to Dr. Lomax, adding that "It is the Last he has to Claim On that [estate]."
