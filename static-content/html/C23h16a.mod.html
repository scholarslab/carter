</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, August 16, 1723, concerning what he has seen in newspapers concerning an act in Parliament about annuities such as one he has, and a bill of exchange he has drawn on Perry to his son-in-law, Mann Page. In a post script he reports the damage to the crops from bad weather and a "spot." Gloucester County seems to suffer the worst.

</a><br><br>This unheaded letter is clearly intended for Perry as he and Carter had corresponded about the annunity  often.  See his <a href="C23h19a.html"target="_wblank">letter to Perry
</a> a few days after this one, for instance.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. It, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
