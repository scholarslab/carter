</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, July 3, 1723, to report on the law passed by the recent General Assembly limiting the quantity of tobacco that can be produced by each planter, and stating some of the arguments in its  favor. He thanks Perry for his recent arguments against the Scots merchants, and hopes Perry will work for the King's support of the new law. He admits to Perry that the new law may not reduce the quantity of  tobacco available for sale because each planter will use his best grounds for his limited number of plants, and will tend them with greater care. He also informs Perry of new taxes on liquor and on slaves, the latter which he is sure that the African company will fight even though Maryland has had a similar  law for some years, and the tax is paid by the colonists rather than the importer. He sends Perry copies of the speeches recently given in the Assembly by the governor and others.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] The trading policies of Scots merchants were of considerable concern to Virginia planters and English  merchants at this time, and the matter came before Parliament in 1723. Vessels sent by Scots were crewed by captains and factors authorized to pay good prices in Virginia which enabled them to  obtain full cargoes. English merchants argued that the only way the Scots could afford to pay such good prices was their ability to avoid paying duties on the tobacco at home. Micajah Perry appeared before Parliament and gave statistics of the duties paid by his firm in earlier years and the far smaller amounts paid in the past several years because his ships could not obtain full cargoes in Virginia.

</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] The Royal African Company, founded in 1672, grew out of earlier slave-trading companies that had been founded in the middle of the  seventeenth century, and that held monopolies on the English trade in slaves. The trade proved so  profitable that Parliament was lobbied successfully to rescind the monopoly and open the trade to anyone which happened in 1698. Carter anticipates that the company will fight the proposed tax on imported slaves even through it is to be paid by the colonial purchasers, not the importers. He was correct for the law was not allowed to stand due to lobbying against it in England. ( http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/home.html
