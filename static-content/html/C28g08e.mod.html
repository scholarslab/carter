</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter refers to the attempt of the colony to persuade Parliament to remove the prohibition against the importation of stemmed tobacco into Britain which it had had passed in 1722. Randolph was the colony's agent to negotiate for the "grand Affair"; his mission would be successful. While Randolph would not leave for England until 1729, Carter had to write well in advance to get his letter aboard a ship sailing in the late summer so that it would reach England before Randolph.

</i>  [Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953.] p. 116.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Samuel Hallows (Hallowes) was a great nephew of John Hallowes, an early landholder in Northumberland and later, Westmoreland County, who was usually identified as of "Nomini" in Westmoreland County. Samuel Hallows lived in Ashworth, County Lancaster, England. The tract in which Carter was interested may have been that of 2400 acres acquired from Hallowes in 1733 by Thomas Lee. Carter had written Hallows <a href="C28f26a.html">1728 May 30
</a> that he would not buy the tract of land. ("Major John Hallowes, 1615-1657" in <a href="Cbibl.html#B38">Norris.  <i>Westmoreland County, Virginia.
</i>  pp. 99-102.
