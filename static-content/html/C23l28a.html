</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Captain [Charles] Broadwater, December 28, 1723, to inform him that he cannot issue a warrant for the land that Broadwater desires on Dogue Run because George Mason and Robert Alexander have already obtained warrants in the area. He does send Broadwater a warrant for use in case Broadwater can identify land he would like in the area.

</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] This probably is present Dogue Creek in Fairfax County, lying along the southwestern side of what was once called Mt. Vernon Neck, near Mt. Vernon. "Dogue Creek is a tidal tributary of the Potomac River in Fairfax County, Virginia, named for the Doeg Indians." ( Alexandria Drafting Company.  <i>Regional Northern Virginia.

</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Pimmots (Pimmits) Run is located in today's Fairfax County, and Wikipedia's description of its meandering route is good:  [It] "runs from Fairfax County to the Potomac River at Chain Bridge in the Arlingwood neighborhood of Arlington County." There is a neighborhood and a park bearing the Pimmits name along its route. Wikipedia also notes, "The stream was named for John Pimmit who in 1675 was an overseer for William Fitzhugh (1651-1701). John was naturalized a citizen in 1679, and died by drowning in 1688-1689. He was survived by three children." It is also stated that a citation was needed for this information. It almost certainly was taken from Fairfax Harrison's <a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks of Old Prince William,
</i> 
</a> pages 68 and 75. ( Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimmit_Run. 12/8/2010
