<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

Kelsick, with Peter How, a merchant of Whitehaven (on the Irish sea in northwest England), traded with the Fredericksburg, Virginia, area from the early 18th century.  ( Paula S. Felder.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] John Gale (<i>ante
</i> 1671-1729) was a Whitehaven merchant whom Carter would write a number of times times between1720 and 1729. "Like his brothers John was engaged in maritime trade. Operating as John Gale and Company, he was named as the owner of the vessel <i>Clotilda,
</i> built in England in 1726 and registered in Whitehaven in 1727 at 25 tons."  His will bequeathed "his half-share in the ships <i>Cumberland
</i> and <i>Somerset
</i>, his share in the <i>Sea Flower
</i>, and 'the whole ship <i>Clothilda
</i>.'"  The Gale family had many connections with the colonies, especially in Virginia and Maryland.

 <br><br><a name="n4"> [4] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
