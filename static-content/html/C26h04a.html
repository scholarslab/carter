</sup> the death of the late Governor <a href="Cbiodir.html#HD">Colo Drysdale,
</a> <br>I have had a Meeting of the Council, by whose concurring <br>advice, I have taken on me the administration of Government <br>as President.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Such is the peaceable State of this Colony, that besides <br>the usual  Proclamacions  for continuing officers in their <br>several Trusts and  Imployments,  there was nothing of <br>moment necessary to be treated of in this last Council, for <br>which reason I forbear troubling <a href="C26h04a.html#n1">Yor Lordps
</a> with a copy <br>of the Minutes: but finding the Duplicates of the Council <br>and Assembly Journals, and the Laws of last Session not yet <br>transmitted to Yor Lordps, I think it my duty to forward them <br>by this Conveyance: but without offering any Remarks on either, <br>since I am credibly informed that was done by the late  Governr  <br>sometime before his death together with the first  copys  of these <br>several Papers.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  shal  miss no opportunity to communicate to Yor <br>Lordps whatever  shal  occurr in the course of my administration <br>wch may be of Service to His Majesty, or necessary for the <br>knowledge of Yor Honble  Board: at present I have only <br>to add that I am with the greatest respect
</p><br><br>My Lords <br><br>Yor. Lordps <br><br>Most dutiful &amp;<br><br>Most obedient humble Servant <br><br><i><hi rend="bold"><i>ROBERT CARTER
