Remain where they were to be <br>Viewed by the Trustees when they Please, but the Debts are  so   Incon<br>-siderable, Except the Sheriffs &amp; Clerks Accounts  they are hardly Worth the <br>Solemn Way of Settling  proposed 
</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be at all Times most Ready to give an  Account  to my Companions as <br>far as I am  Concerned  in Management when they Desire it, but for <br>a  Dictatorship   amongst Us I am unwilling to  yield  to; will Rather <br>Cease to Meddle  with  any Dead Mans Estate while I Live
</p>   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is an Account  of my Proceedings hitherto.<br> A Short ime after the Death of  Esquire   Wormeley,  We  took probate upon his <br>will,  Colonel  Jenings not there, and that  We   might be Enabled for the Divi<br>-sion  Moved  the Court that an appraisement might be made by Judicious <br>Gentlemen and Obtained Order Accordingly.  Several   Meetings  We   <br>had Month after Month, where I Constantly attended for the Division, but <br>for want of a Suitable Nombrs. of Appraisers, The Matter was not Effected <br> until  December,  Colonel   Jenings  at none of those Times, meeting, In the <br>-mean time, I have not  been    wanting in taking Care of the business of the Plan<br>-tations, a very Good  Crop   was made, is <a href="C02d06a.mod.html#n6"><sic  corr="prized">Preizd [sic]

</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Crop   made by  Esquire  Wormeley I  shipped   as followith 
</p>   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten   hogsheads went to <a href="Cbiodir.html#TC">Mr. Corbin
</a>,  which  I Left my Own  Tobacco   out for <br>and Lay by me all the year, He Writes me  General   he had soldfor <br>Nine pence 1/2 But no Account  as  yet.  Sixteen hogsheads went to <a href="Cbiodir.html#FL">Mr. Lee
</a> <br>of the same  Tobacco  sold at Nine pence 3/4,  Ten   pence, and  Ten   pence 1/4 <br>he  has  sent an  Account  of Sales but no account   Current  Twenty seven hogsheads <br>went to <a href="Cbiodir.html#JM">Mathews

</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goods for the familys use Lost as above were sent for to Mathews &amp;c. <br>Amounting as per Invoice to &pound;86:2:2.

</a><br><br><a name="n3"> [3] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

</a><br><br><a name="n7">[7] "The governor's Council, also known as the Council of State or simply the Council, consisted of about a dozen of colonial Virginia's wealthiest and most prominent men. Beginning in the 1630s the Crown appointed Council members. . . . Crown appointments were lifetime appointments. From 1625, when Virginia became a royal colony, until the outbreak of the American Revolution (1775-1783), the Council members advised the royal governor or his deputy, the lieutenant governor, on all executive matters. The Council and the governor together constituted the highest court in the colony, known initially as the Quarter Court and later as the General Court. The Council members also served as members of the General Assembly; from the first meeting of the assembly in 1619 until 1643 the governor, Council members, and burgesses all met in unicameral session. After 1643 the Council members met separately as the upper House of the General Assembly."
