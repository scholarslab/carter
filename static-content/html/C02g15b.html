</i>

</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Francis Lee that he has sent 20 hogsheads of tobacco and that some of the other trustees of the Ralph Wormeley estate are pushing other merchants for the estate business, but as he has control of the estate's business on the Rappahannock (while Edmund Jenings supervises that on the York), he will continue to send crops to Lee. Carter states that it is strange that Wormeley, who had inherited large estates, should regularly have been in financial trouble. He notes that some of the trustees had previously wanted to bring Wormeley's sons home from England, but they are now content; their mother had asked that their expenses be kept at a moderate level, and this is important if Ralph and John are to inherit good estates. And he adds that he has observed that those boys  educated in England who had the most pocket money and finest clothes did not obtain the best education. He closes by noting that his sister-in-law, Elizabeth Wormeley, has a right to one-fifth of the proceeds of the previous year's crop, and will market her share herself in the future.
