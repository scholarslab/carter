</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to William Robertson,  clerk of the Council, June 21, 1727, giving him information about the plan for the convoying of the merchant ships in the colony as they sail for Britain, and requesting that he be sent all the public papers so that he can see that they are sent off with the fleet. He is especially concerned that the "Order for the Embargo Should go."
