Mr. Benj. Grayson<br>
 


<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By William Manuel I gave you all the necessary <br>
directions for the Government of self in relation to the  Miners s according <br>
to the circumstances of their Case as it then stood, &amp; I hope you have fol= <br>
lowed my orders exactly since which yours of the 14th. Instant by Pockely <br>
came to the hands of my son <a href="Cbiodir.html#RC2">Robert
</a> &amp; from him to me it brought the <br>
most promising hopes that ever we have yet had the samples you sent <br>
are very rich not inferior to the best of Skilers Ore since that my son <br>
<a href="Cbiodir.html#CC1">Charles
</a> met with a random story that the vein grew larger rather than <br>
less &amp; now from Warner in a letter dated the 23d. Instant he tells me that <br>
on the Wednesday before at Prince William Court Shaw told him of a fine <br>
vein you had discovered that in the week before you had  mined  three Tons <br>
of this Ore that it  Yields  above half Copper, that he would give 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2
</i>-
</center><br><br>
fifty pounds Per Ton for it here in the County; These are flushing <br>
hopes &amp; if they are true we hope &amp; earnestly desire you will use <br>
your utmost industry &amp; Courage to make Hay while the sun shines <br>
&amp; let the  Miners  want no assistance you can give them with your <br>
people &amp; now your Corn is laid aside you have it in your power <br>
to make use of as many of the Hands as you can fairly employ in rais=<br>
ing as much of this Ore as possibly you can between this and the<br>
last of September two or three hundred Ton of this Ore would <br>
lick all old sores  pretty  whole &amp; make the wheels of Action <br>
run so smooth that we should be enabled to support all our <br>
Charges with pleasure, My Son Charles purposes to be up with <br>
you next month &amp; I am not without hopes of seeing you in  September  <br>

Wants an Invoice of the things sent is here  enclosed  every thing <br>
comes that you sent for except the Corn which I could not now <br>
send without hindering the  Schooner  three or four days at least  which  <br>
I was very unwilling to do &amp; there is no reason to doubt of your  <br>
wanting of it soon &amp; my son Robert assures me there is thirty or <br>
forty barrls. of Corn to spare at his <a href="C31g27a.mod.html#n2">bull run Quarter
</a> which <br>
you may have recourse to in Case of necessity but that is impos= <br>
sible to be your Case before we can send you a supply from hence
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely you are very brisk in <a href="C31g27a.mod.html#n3">Spawling
</a> &amp; barreling of this <br>
ore &amp; that  your   Team  is daily employd in Carting it down to the <br>
Landing It would be very pleasing to us to have the  Schooner  turn <br>
back with a full Load &amp; I have orderd her if you think It proper to <br>
to   [<i>sic
</i>]
</i> stop her to  lie  at <a href="C31g27a.mod.html#n4">Occoquan
</a> Eight or ten days, I have sent you <br>
two thousand twenty penny nails which  Is all that I can possibly <br>
spare at present &amp; with these you may lay down the floors <br>
&amp; have enough to spare for the other business there is no necessity for <br>
for   [<i>sic
</i>]
</i> your  thorough  nailing of it at present, that may be done <br>
when you have a fresh supply of nails

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Benjamin Grayson was, according to Fairfax Harrison, "one of the earliest of the Scots merchants to be established on Quantico, where Dumfries was to arise." He was appointed a justice of Prince William County in November 1731. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks. . . .
</i>  pp. 156
</a>and <a href="Cbibl.html#B10">McIlwaine.  <i>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .
</i> , 4[1721-1739]: 256.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Bull Run Quarter was a  farm on bull Run Creek in Prince William County identified in Carter's will as "that tract or parcel of land I lately bought of William rust lying in Hartford County upon the branches of Bull Run"  and in his inventory as "belonging to the Estate [of] Robt Carter Junr Esq. . . ." There were then 19 cattle on the property. Fairfax Harrison wrote that in 1726 there was a bill before the House of Burgesses proposing to "divide Stafford [County] at Aquia creek and create above that boundary a county to be named <i>Hartford,
</i> but after debate the proposal was rejected." (<a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks. . . .
</i>  pp. 311-312, citing the  <i> Journals of the House of Burgesses, 1727-1740.
</i>  pp. 408-414.

</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3]  According to  the  <i>Oxford English Dictionary,
</i>  spawling has to do with spittle or expectoration. However, a web search reveals that the term is used today in mining and civil engineering to mean breaking fragments from a face of stone or ore. Perhaps the term was used in Carter's day, and he had learned it from his miners. ("Webster's Online Dictionary, " http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/spall, 4/29/2006.)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] The Occaquan River is a major tributary of  the Potomac River that lay in Stafford County in Carter's day. Much of the river today is known as the Bull Run, and forms the boundary between Fairfax and Prince William counties, and to the west, between Loudoun and Prince William  counties.  ( Alexandria Drafting Company.  <i>Regional Northern Virginia.
</i>  [Alexandria, VA: Alexandria Drafting Company, 2002.] 
</a>  Coverage of Fairfax, Fauquier, Loudoun, and Prince William counties.)

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] The tare weight is the weight of the container "that is deducted from the gross weight to obtain the net weight" of the product held in the container. ( <i>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,
</i>  4th ed.,  Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000. Updated in 2009. Quoted online by <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tare"target="_wblank">The Free Dictionary,
</a> 9/13/2011.)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] By "neat ore" Carter means "to gain (a sum) as a net profit; to net."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n7">[7] A pistole, often called a doblon, was a "Spanish gold double-escudo dating from the 1530s and surviving into the 19th cent.; (also) any of various coins derived from or resembling this from the 17th and 18th centuries." See the illustration on page 5 of  John J. McCusker.  <i>Money &amp; Exchange in Europe &amp; America 1600-1775 A Handbook.
</i>  [Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press for the Institute of Early American History and Culture, 1978.],
</a> and discussion in note 3 on page 6. (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online. 
</i> 
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n8">[8]  <i>Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary,
</i>  1913 states that a rundlet is "a small barrel of no certain dimensions. It may contain from 3 to 20 gallons, but it usually holds about 14 1/2 gallons."
