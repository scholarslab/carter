</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, June 2, 1721, that the London ships in the colony have dropped their freight rates to &pound;8, and even so, many will not obtain cargoes. The prospects for a crop of tobacco this year are poor as the young plants are being cut off in the beds by worms. The loss of the crop may not be a bad thing.
