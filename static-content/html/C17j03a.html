</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, October3, 1717, an addition to an earlier letter (probably that of September16, 1717) hoping that the victory achieved by the Tories at the lastsession (of Parliament) will result in peace in the country and will"promote the real good of the community" and "the securities of [the]Protestant Religion." He comments that the colony understands thatthe repeal of the tobacco law has been accomplished and that plantersare giving "orders to strip in the old way." He is glad to hear thatthe <i>Carter
</i> has reached home safely and hopesfor her early return,and concludes with a comment that the recent "gust" has not damagedcrops as badly as had been feared.

</a>.  Our great news <br>at this time is the triumph the <br>Torys have gained in the last Session. <br>May all these divisions end in the <br>peace of the nation.  Its no great <br> matter to us who is uppermost, <br> so they promote the real good of the <br> community and the  securtie   of <br> <a href="C17j03a.html#n2">the Protestant Religion
</a>.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="C17j03a.html#n3">repeal of the Tobo. Law
</a> is a <br> believed truth and grounded on<br> some of the merchants letters.Mr. <br><a href="Cbiodir.html#MP">Perry
</a> writes he took it to be neer <br> effected: so  wee  give orders to strip in <br> the old way.The <a href="Cbiodir.html#CS"> " Carter's " 
</a> saftie  is a piece of<br> pleasing news. I hope you'll think <br> it proper to dispatch her back to us <br><a href="C17j03a.html#n4">with the first

</center><br><br><i>Source copy consulted: 
</i>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparentlythere was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- nowlost -- from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. Asthey are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity.

</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Governor Alexander Spotswood had gotten throughthe General Assembly in 1713 an act "for preventing frauds in Tobaccopayments And for the better Improveing the Staple of Tobacco." Amongother provisions (such as the establishment of tobacco inspectionshouses and of inspectors of tobacco), this law prohibited thestemming of tobacco. There was immediate opposition tothe law, but Dodson in his biography of Spotswood notes that thelieutenant governor had the power of appointment of the tobaccoinspectors, and "twenty-seven burgesses, a clear  majority, weretobacco agents" in 1714, which helped defeat amendments to the actthat were brought up at that session.  The colonial oppositiontogether with opposition from the English merchants led to the repealof the act in 1717; the news was announced in Virginia on November12.
