</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to William Robertson, clerk of the Council, July 15, 1727, directing him to send the militia commissions for Brunswick and Northumberland counties. He reports news of the raising of the siege of Gibralter, and the arrival of a slave ship. He asks for information about a minister named Thomas Bayley from North Carolina who has applied for a post in Northumberland County, but Carter has been alerted that he is the Bayley who was forced to leave Virginia several years earlier because of misconduct.

England was at war with Spain, but the war was one in which not much blood was shed and which was soon over." As Carter was writing in 1727, the Spanish had not been successful in their seige of Gibralter, and  had given up.  The conflict would end in 1729 with the treaty of Seville by which Britain obtained Gibraltar. ( H.R. McIlwaine, <i>ed.

</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Thomas Baylie (Bayley, Bailey, b. 1683?) was one of the most notorious colonial Virginia clergymen. Commissary Blair had written to the bishop of London in 1724, "We have at present two Ministers (Mr. Thomas Baylie and . . . ) so very scandalous for drunkenness and fighting and Quarreling in their drink that many grevious complaints are brought to me against them, and indeed the Country rings of the scandal given by them." Baylie was the minister at that time of Newport Parish, Isle of Wight County. The parish determined to get rid of Baylie, and in 1725, brought an agreement to the Governor and Council by which Baylie agreed to relinquish his ministry and leave the colony; he disputed the amount of salary he was to receive and was awarded the full year.

</a><br><br><a name="n5"> [5] Richard Hickman (d. 1732) had been deputy clerk of Middlesex County in 1709. After Governor Hugh  Drysdale's death, the Council appointed him to manage the Governor's house and its gardens.  His name appears a number of times in the Council minutes as he was the doorkeeper, and as he took out land patents. This letter shows that Hickman must have done other work for the colonial government. (Edward W. James.  "Libraries in Colonial Virginia."    <i>William and Mary Quarterly.
