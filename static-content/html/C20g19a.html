</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his son John, then in London studyinglaw, July 19, 1720, about an opinion that he has received from SirRobert Raymond in England concerning "Mr. Lee's Deed of Settlement,"expressing his dissatisfaction with it. Sir Robert's opinion hadindicated "a wide Difference between a bond Debt and a debt upon Simple Contract" and Carter expounds upon the trouble such aninterpretation will create for the colonists. He asks John to attemptto see Sir Robert or another able attorney to have certain points inthe opinion expanded upon, and adds that he will consult lawyers inVirginia. He sends family news, and indicates his need for aschoolmistress for "my three Younger Children . . . at home wth. me Mary, Lucy, &amp; George," noting that he haswritten Mr. Perry about one, but John may be able to assist.

Therefrom for the recovery of my money, Sr. Robt. <br>makes a wide Difference between a bond Debt and a debt<br>upon Simple Contract now If all Debts are resolvable <br>intothese two mine must be Construed to be a Contract <br>Debt. &amp; soaccording to Sir Robt. not recoverable out <br>of a real estate, If This be Law we in thePlantations <br>are in a very Dangerous <siccorr="Condition">Condicon [sic]  for we have nothing <br>but theMerchts  Accots. for our Security, and any Merchts  <br>for the <abbrexpan="Advancement">Advancemt. of his family may Throw all the <br>money he has of others topurchase a real Estate <br>wth. &amp; when he's Dead his family goesinto the possession of It <br>&amp; his Claimers are wth.out remedy,but to the point as <br>for the pretence of a free contract that wasmade between <br>Lee &amp; his wife before the <notetarget="n2">Coverture
