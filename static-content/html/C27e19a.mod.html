</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, May 19, 1727, reporting the arrival of Captain Bowman and his accounts with Stark. He reminds Stark that he wants these accounts regularly, and notes that he has paid John Pemberton the 2 1/2 per cent Pemberton was charged for a bill of exchange he had written on Stark. He has suffered great losses among his slaves, and will have to write bills on Stark to pay for the new ones. He complains that Stark has not reported to him that the <i>Ann &amp; Eliza,
</i> on which he had shipped tobacco to Stark, had been driven ashore in a storm, but the cargo saved. Thirty hogsheads of tobacco will be sent Stark by Captain Bowman.
