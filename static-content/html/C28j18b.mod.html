<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Prince William County  resident [Robert Jones, October 18, 1728], to give his manager instructions about the care of hogs, the handling of corn, butter, and hides, construction at the new town of Falmouth, and the use of nails in adding laths to the slave cabins on the plantations under Jones's charge. He expresses the need to keep the slaves warm in the winter because it will mean fewer fatalities.

</b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. This date has been tentatively assigned because the letters immediately following it in the letter book were written in mid-October 1728. The earlier page or pages of this letter book are missing, and the pages on which this draft was written have lost material along their edges as well as a large section that is missing on one side.

Here Carter seated the Lodge Quarter mentioned in his will."  Timothy Dargan was its overseer in the <a href="C33inven.html"target="_wblank">1733 inventory.
