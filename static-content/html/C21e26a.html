</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant, John Pemberton, May 26, 1721, that he is sending him 40 hogsheads of tobacco on board the <i>Content
</i>. He reports that two of Pemberton's ships are loading freight for London. He was pleased with Pemberton's report of sales of tobacco sent last year by Captain Hancock. The 20 hogsheads he sent by Enoch Robinson were purchased by Carter and Pemberton is to get as much as he can for it. He concludes with the hope that Parliament will find some way to settle the "South Sea Company" scandals in a way that will restore trade and the nation's credit.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

</i>, a Liverpool ship.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n2">[2]  The impost was the duty imposed by Britain on imported tobacco.

</a>  <br><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Carter refers to the scandal of the value of the stock of the South Sea and other companies which wild speculation had driven enormously high in June 1720, and which was nearly worthless several months later. Many fortunes were made and lost. Perhaps the most succesful speculator was Sir Robert Walpole who made a fortune, retired, and then was called to save the nation as prime minister, a post he held from 1721 until 1742.
