</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to [John Wormeley] September 3, 1723, that his recent trip to visit the younger man has brought on an attack of gout which has confined him to his house for over a week. He turns to his attempts to obtain money due the proprietors from Edmund Jenings in which Wormeley is assisting him and states that he will not take Jenings to court immediately as he has written Colonel Cage in England. The sale of Negroes from the estate may raise the sums needed, as will taking over an estate.

</b> Robert Carter letter book, 1723 June 16-1724 April 23, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. There is a nineteenth-century transcript of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. 
</a><br><br>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the return address on this draft.
</a><br><br>Carter's diary entry for August 24, 1723, noted that he had visited "mr wormeleys wth my Son" and that he  "came home that Night slept in the boat good part of the way the Awning down." It seems likely that this draft was intended for a letter to Wormeley.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Wormeley (1689-1727), a younger son of Ralph Wormeley (d. 1701) for whom Carter had been a trustee in John's youth. When his older brother, Ralph died in 1714, John inherited all of their father's considerable estate in Middlesex and York counties.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter remembered his Latin well; the phrase "littera scripta manet" means "the written word endures."
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Catherine Culpeper (d. 1719) was the widow of the fifth Lord Fairfax (d. 1710). From her father, the 2nd Lord Culpeper, she had inherited about 1689 his five-sixths interest in the Northern Neck Proprietary in Virginia. Lord Fairfax had consulted Micajah Perry about the affairs of the Proprietary, and Perry had recommended Robert Carter to be the Virginia agent in 1702. He held the post until 1710 when Lady Fairfax transferred the agency to Edmund Jenings with Thomas Lee as the deputy agent. When she died in 1719, she bequeathed her Virginia property to her son Tom, but she made Wiliam Cage and Edward Filmer, trustees of the proprietary. Filmer soon died, and Cage, a kinsman of the 6th Lord Fairfax, became the sole trustee. From his grandmother, Margaret Lady Culpeper, the 6th Lord Fairfax inherited the other one-sixth of the Proprietary. Cage consulted Perry, and Robert Carter was again made agent in 1721, holding the post until his death ten years later. (For sources, see those listed at the end of the <a href="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/#Northern Neck"target="_wblank"> discussion of the Proprietary
</a> on the home page.)
</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.
