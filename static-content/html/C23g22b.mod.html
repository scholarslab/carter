</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Landon Jones, son of his late sister-in-law, Mary (Landon) Jones Swan, July 22, 1723,  concerning his mother's death and the status of law suits against Carter as her executor brought by Thomas Edwards, clerk of the Lancaster County court.  Carter informs Jones, who lives in London, that his mother's son-in-law, John Swan, had made an agreement with her concerning improvements to the Swan estate but her papers were destroyed at her death. John Swan's widow has married Edwards who claims the majority of the estate. Carter plans to fight Edwards' suits aggressively, and if he wins, will see that Jones receives his portion of the estate.

</a>
</i> a little petty Fogging Lawyer the  clerk   of our County that  has   <br>as much Mettle and more cunning for Contention  than   <br>his predecessor had and  has   commenced against me as <br>your Mothers administrator two suits to our last  General   <br>Court the one in Chancery and the other in Debt for <br>40&pound; Sterling To let you into the Ground of this last Suit <br>you must know that your Mother and her Son entered <br>in to
</i> Articles of Accomodation, he was to make  several   buildings <br>for her residence to deliver up the half of her Husbands <br>Estate Slaves  Lands
</i> &amp;C, the profits hereof she was to Enjoy during <br>her life her part was to Resign her rights in the Mansion <br>house and to pay towards her husbands Legacies 40&pound; <br>during Swans life little or nothing was done towards <br>these buildings for your Mother's reception,  <S><font color="red">She  lived   and died<br>with me for some Years before her death
</font>
</S>  and yet this Edwards <br>thinks it a great peice of Justice to contend for this Money <br>Your Mother  though   it was her harsh fortune to Spend so much <br>of her  latest   Years in Strife, was willing to leave peace <br>behind her in order to which she gave it  in
</i> charge to one of <br>her  confidants   to destroy all her papers and I suppose th [e]

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must believe this tedious course of Law cost <br>a great deal of Money and that this money came out of my <br>pocket, upon a fair Accot: your Mother stands in my Debt <br>about 70&pound; most of it Money to the Lawyers however if I can <br>get the Victory over Edwards my Design is to let you have <br>the Slave or the Value of her which will be most Accepta<br>ble to you,  although   these Suits before they are at an end I <br>reckon will Stand me in near Thirty pounds more but <br>let them cost me what they will I purpose Gods sparing my <br>life to defend them with Vigour
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By your Letter I Ap<br>prehend you have some place about the Inns of Court  [If]
