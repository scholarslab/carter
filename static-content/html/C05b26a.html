</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Corbin, February 26, 1705, to thank him for two letters and that he does not know how to respond to Corbin's comments about the "Mattrs. of State," an affair in which Carter is deeply involved. He  notes the deaths of William Byrd, David Gwinn, and Robert Tayloe, master of the Corbin,  which is being repaired on the bank of Corotoman Creek. In a lengthy postscript dated March 8th, he writes that he has received two more letters from Corbin, one via Barbados and the other through Pennsylvania which he suspects was opened. He is pleased with the sale of the Rappahannock tobacco but cannot comment on the needed work on the Corbin about which Corbin's brother will be better able to write him; he adds that the present master of the ship, Richard Cudlip, is not well qualified for the work.
