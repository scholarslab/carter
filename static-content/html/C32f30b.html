</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant  Alderman [Micajah] Perry, June 1732, to alert him to renewed attacks upon the proprietary in the current assembly, and to send a record of "their votes" as he has to Thomas Lord Fairfax. He relates the problems ship masters are having in finding complete cargoes, and hopes this will mean a better market for tobacco.

</a> Affairs. <a href="C32f14a.html"target="_wblank">The Burgesses 
</a>are now making a fresh attack against <br>his Lordship's grant as you will see by their Votes, which I have thought it my <br>Duty by this first Opportunity to transmit to his Lordship tht he may be upon <br>his Guard in the Defence of his Estate; &amp; I send also a Copy of these Votes for your <br>Perusal. The Money they voted for  solliciting  their Petition in the Former <br>Session was disallowed by the Council; but whether it will meet with the <br>same Fate now I cannot take upon me to say. I expect the Gentlemen of <br><a href="C32f30b.html#n2">our Revenue
</a> will leave no Stone unturned to carry their Point for <br>Reasons I have formerly mentioned to you.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] "The receiver-generalship was a royal appointment" and the official was required to give bond both to the lord of the treasury and to the governor. "Those who filled the office of receiver-general were practially all councillors. . . . The duties of the receiver-general included the receiving of the quit-rents, the revenue arising from the export duty of two shillings per hogshead on tobacco, the one penny per pound on tobacco exported from Virginia . . .  the port duty, which was the revenue arising from the fifteen pence per ton on all vessels arriving in the colony, and all funds of the colony not received by the treasurer. . . .  He paid out of the revenue . . .  the salaries of the officers of the colony, also those of the auditor-general of the colonies and the solicitor of Virginia affairs, both of whom lived in England. All the public expenses of the colony, except, of course, those paid out of the funds held by the treasurer, were paid out of the funds received in his office. . . .  He of course reported to the lords of the treasury all payments made on the order of the governor. The accounts of the revenues and the reports of disbursements forwarded to the lords of the treasury were certified to by the auditor and the governor, and sent by the governor."
