And they think that both her Majestys <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Service &amp; this Countries interest will be greatly promoted thereby.

</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;That the matters contained in the Complaint for the most part are Mal-Administrations in the -- <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Council   in the  General  : Court &amp; in the Upper house of the  General   Assembly; So that the  Council   are not <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;only the best acquainted with the transactions there, but also they are most nearly concerned in thm. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;as relateing chiefly to their Libertys &amp; priviledges in which  the House of Burgesses have no right <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;to intermeddle.

</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;That (whatever  has   been suggested) the Complainants have always been far from <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;endeavouring to raise partys or factions or to disturb the peace of the Country; on the Contrary their <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;great moderation  has   appeared in the patience &amp; Submission they they have shewed notwithstanding <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the many  injuries   &amp;  indignities   (not to be mentioned) tht. have been put upon themselves &amp; others <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;by the Governrs. unjustifiable behaviour, &amp; in this particular Case they addressed themselves in the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;most peaceable &amp; humble manner to her Majesty the proper fountain of justice for their <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;relief, &amp; she  has   been gratiously pleased to take the same into her own Cognizance <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the House of Burgesses cannot concerne themselves in this matter without arrogateing <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;to themselves a power to make a previous determination to tht. of her Majesty in an affair <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;which  she  has   been pleased in an Especial manner to reserve for her own Consideration.

And it is impossible <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the House of Burgesses should take upon them to make any  Judgement  . in this matter with out <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;going directly Contrary to her Majestys pleasure in this particular, &amp; to the very express Letter as <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;well as intent of the command from the Lords Commissioners for Trade.

</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;That the House of Burgesses cannot take upon them to intermeddle in this affair without making <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves Judges of the Rights &amp; Priviledges of the  Council  , which  in Consequence may create lasting <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;divisions &amp; misunderstandings between  them   &amp; the Burgesses; For whatever determination shall be <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;made here it cannot be supposed tht. the Complainants will be so far wanting either in their duty to her <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Majesty or in their regard to their  own   Characters or the Countrys interest as to  Sit   Still patiently <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp; not endeavour to  Set   all persons &amp; their proceedings in a true light. And it is not improbable <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;but the misfortunes tht. may ensue to the Country upon such differences, may be what is chiefly <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;aimed at.

</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Complainants have been very Cautious of Concerning themselves with  the House of Burgesses <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;tht. they might not give  them   the least umbrage of disatisfaction. And surely the House of Burgesses <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;have great reason to be as Cautious tht. they do not themselves  sew   those seeds of discord &amp;C<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Contention which  may in a short time grow up to interrupt the peace &amp; happiness of the --  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;whole Country.

</i>New York (Colony). Council Papers. State Archives, New York State Education Department, Albany, Vol. 51, p. 32a-b.  This document was copied for Governor Francis Nicholson's private papers, and was carried by him to New York when he later became governor of that colony. The papers remained in New York, passing into the custody of the State Library which burned around the turn of the twentieth century, causing some damage to this series of records. These records have been transferred to the state archives, and there are several copies of this document in the series. The text was transcribed from one that seems to be most contemporary in its handwriting to the early eighteenth century, and two other copies in the series have been used to supply words in the copy text that were damaged by the fire.
