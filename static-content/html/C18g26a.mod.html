</center><br><br><i>Source copy consulted: 
</i>  LancasterCounty Marriage Bonds, 1718, I, 12, Archives Research Services,Library of Virginia, Richmond. This is the recipient's copy and  isentirely in the hand of and is signed by RC as is noted by the useof italics. William Dare was clerkof Lancaster County at this time. The single sheet has lost a portionwhich has removed much of the address on the reverse but it probablyread: "[William Da]re | [Lan]castr" since the last letters remain. Cloth tape obscures portions of the contemporary docket. What can beread shows:  "July 28th 1718 | [del]ivered to T C." A docket in alater hand reads, "Man Page | to | Judith Carter" and scrawled belowthis in another hand is "1718." (<a href="Cbibl.html#B36">Dobyns <hirend="italics">et al.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence. The returnaddress, county, and colony have beenadded for clarity to this unheaded letter.
</a><br>  <br><br><a name="n1">[1] RC's daughter Judith (1695-c. 1750) married MannPage of "Rosewell," Gloucester County.
</a> <br><br><a name="n2">[2] Thomas Carter (1672-1733) was the second of thatname in Lancaster County, and may have been RC's first cousin asthere is evidence that their fathers were brothers. He lived at"Barford" in the northern part of the county. ( CatherineAdams Jones.  <i>The Early Thomas Carters of Lancaster County,Virginia
