</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, August 26, 1723, reporting the serious damage that recent bad weather has done to crops up and down the Rappahannock, on the York, and in Maryland. He adds that a short crop may benefit planters who ship only stripped tobacco before the act of Parliament banning its importantion into England goes into effect. If Dawkins plans to send the <i>Carter,
</i> she should sail early. He closes by writing that he hopes to see one or both of his sons before Christmas.

</i> <br><br>Augst. 26. 1723 -- <br><br>Mr. Wm. Dawkins<br> <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already hinted to You the great damage our Crops <br>has sustaind by the Rains &amp; winds. I have had Intelligence <br>from the head to the foot of <a href="C23h26a.mod.html#n1">our River
</a> I may say from the Northern <br>Side of York too &amp; the Cry is as bad in Maryland, people  that   I <br>Converse with  generally   reckon there will hardly be half a Crop <br>but I dare not give any  orders   about keeping my Tobacco  having so <br>severely  smarted for it these late Years, One would reason that these <br> stories   &amp;  the
</i>  near   taking place of the <a href="C23h26a.mod.html#n2">Act of Parliament
</a> against stem<br>=ing Tobacco  would be of considerable service to us that ship nothing <br>but  stripped   Tobacco  
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither dare I say any thing About the  Carter,  If You <br>Adventure to send her, It will be highly proper to make her an <br>Early Ship,  <S><font color="red">I am

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I am big with hopes of seeing one if not both my <a href="C23h26a.mod.html#n3">Sons
</a> <br>On this Side of Christmas which shall conclude me at <br>present. --  
</p><br>Your  humble Servant <br><br>Since the above I have drawn on You <br>for &pound;32"8" to  Captain    Thomas Kennedy. <br>which  desire Your   payment   of at time. -- <br><hr><center><h3>NOTES

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
