In one of your's this year you <br>advise me topurchase you some Tobo <br>upon bills. In another you  control  <br>yourself upon the news you hadof the <br>high prices given here.  Indeed there <br> has   been no such timeproduced <br>the likewithin my  memory.  21, <br>22, 23, 24 &amp; 25 <a href="C18g27a.mod.html#n1">p Ct

</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your brother <a href="C18g27a.mod.html#n3">John
</a>, the <siccorr="Parliament">Paria=<br>ment [sic]  man, stands in my debt for <br>nine Hhds of Tobo I sent him two<br>years ago -- would never yet let me <br>know what he sold it for. I am <br>very sorry there issuch a flaw in <br>the reputation of one of your  family. <br> I think   you shouldbe so much <br>concernedat it as to attempt everything <br>in your power to bring him into the <br>humour of doing me justice:and <br>pray interest yourself so much at <br>least in my behalf to get an accot <br>what is become of mygoods. I <br>find  it is   in vain for me to write <br>to him. You'll do your family but <br>a <addresp="editor">[omission in text]

Who is in the <br>wrong I can't tell.One story is <br>always good  "until ">till another is heard. <br>I wish you may be so much <br>friends toyour own peace to <br>compromise your differences  among <br>yourselves.  Few get so much in the<br>end in going into contentions of <br>Law, set aside the Lawyers and Officers. But this is none of my<br>business.

</a>  <br><br><a name="n2">[2] Burridge was located in Lyme Regis, Dorset.
</a>  <br><br><a name="n">[3] John Burridge (1681?-1753), brother of Robert, wasa merchant in London trading primarily "to Guinea and the West Indies." It is not surprising thatRC could not obtain the sales report and money he mentions in this letter; in 1717, John Burridge'sestate had been seized by the Crown for non-payment of duties  on wine. John Burridge represented Lyme inParliament from 1710-1728. [Sedgwick,  Parliament, I, 509].
