</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Colonel George Mason of Stafford County, November 10, 1727, to inform him that he cannot issue grants for two pieces of land because warrants were not first obtained. He sets out problems with the land encroaching upon that for which Francis Awbrey already has warrants, and other problems with lands desired by Mason. He reminds Mason that he remains interested in land offered for sale by John Mercer provided Mason will sell him an adjoining piece.

</center><br>Colonel George Mason -- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [Corotoman, Lancaster County, Virginia]
</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Novr. the 10th: 1727<br><br>Colonel George Mason -- <br> <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Sorry I was not at home when you were at <br>my house but you ought to thank  yourself  you might Justly reckon <br>my duty then obliged my Attendance on the <a href="C27k10a.mod.html#n2">general Court.
</a> As to the <br>two  plats  you have  returned  without date and made without  warrants  <br>I can do nothing upon them and I think it a Presumption in <a href="C27k10a.mod.html#n3">Savage
</a> <br>to Survey the <a href="C27k10a.mod.html#n4"> Proprietors'  Land
</a> without the Leave of their Agent and I must <br>never Encourage Such a practice <a href="C27k10a.mod.html#n5">Awbrey
</a> had a  warrant  Some time <br>ago for that  piece  of Land which  Joins  upon him and  has   returned  <br>a  plat  made by <a href="C27k10a.mod.html#n6">Mr. Thomas
</a> which he informs me was  Surveyed  <br>before Savage  Surveyed  for you and it Seems takes in a part of his Im<br>provements An Error which he was led into by Savage not  running  <br>the last line, now it would be very unfair  <S><font color="red">not
</font>
</S>  to grand this land that he<br>is in a regular way of  getting, 
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the two warrants you had from me Some time <br>ago when you return the  Plats  according to the  places  of your  Entries  <br>I Shall be ready to Issue Deeds  <S><font color="red">accordingly
</font>
</S>  for but Thomas  demonstrates  <br>to me that the Second he  has   Surveyed  for Awbrey is not within either <br>of your  Entries.  Your upper Entry for 4000 Acres begins upon a  piece  <br>of Land Sold by Savage to Phillips and Lacewell but never no Deed <br> Issued  for the Land, and upon their being runaway Awbrey both <br> Entered  for it and  Surveyed  it upon his warrant and your lower En<br>try begins at the lower End of Savages Sale so that neither way your <br>Warrants can  Include  it Thus this matter Stands between you how<br>ever I Shall delay Some time before I give Awbrey a Deed to hear what <br>you have to Object against it.

</S>   Enntries  left with my man for a 1000  acres
</i> <br>Mr. Thomas Assures me is within a  warrant  he  has  Already in his <br>hands. The other Entry I have Sent you a warrant for directed to <br>Mr. Thomas. Savage  has   played  me so many tricks and is so uni<br> versally  Complained  of that I do not care how little use I make of him <br>The other will be up in your parts Soon upon other business and then <br>he will be ready to Serve you,
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Should have been glad to have  discoursed  you about <br><a href="C27k10a.mod.html#n7">Mr. Mercers
</a> Land which I am Still willing to be a purchaser of <br>at a reasonable price but I cannot think it to be worth so much as he <br> Asks Allthough  the  Convenience  of it to me invites me to give more  than  <br>Ordinary for it Provided I can have a good title and you agree to let <br>me have that part of the Land  Adjoining to me I am

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] "The governor's Council, also known as the Council of State or simply the Council, consisted of about a dozen of colonial Virginia's wealthiest and most prominent men. Beginning in the 1630s the Crown appointed Council members. . . . Crown appointments were lifetime appointments. From 1625, when Virginia became a royal colony, until the outbreak of the American Revolution (1775-1783), the Council members advised the royal governor or his deputy, the lieutenant governor, on all executive matters. The Council and the governor together constituted the highest court in the colony, known initially as the Quarter Court and later as the General Court. The Council members also served as members of the General Assembly; from the first meeting of the assembly in 1619 until 1643 the governor, Council members, and burgesses all met in unicameral session. After 1643 the Council members met separately as the upper House of the General Assembly."

He had been appointed surveyor for King George County the year after that county was formed in 1720, and was referred to then as "gentleman." He was surveyor of Stafford County when he particpated in the Fairfax survey.

He eventually lost his license to practice law, and turned to the land speculation that he had begun as soon as he reached Virginia.
