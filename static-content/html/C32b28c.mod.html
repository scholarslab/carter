</i> arrived in very good order, and to thank him for handling several shipments of tobacco even though the merchant has been writing Carter that he no longer wishes to be in that trade. Carter sends a bill of lading (not present) for 50 hogsheads, and asks Pemberton to have Foster Cunliffe handle it if he will not. He adds remarks about the difficulties posed by the handling of tobacco required by the new inspection law, and sends a bill of exchange (not present). He encloses a letter to Foster Cunliffe about receiving and selling the shipment of tobacco if Pemberton will not handle it,

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Foster Cunliffe (d. 1767) was a merchant and prominent citizen of Liverpool who worked to expand manufacturing and the capacity of the harbor; he served a number of terms as mayour   He and Richard Gildart undertook "a major reorginization of business with Maryland and Virginia . . . beginning in the early 1720's [they] sent numerous factors to the region." They established stores in which retail goods were sold, purchased the produce of the region, had it ready for loading when ships arrived, and also moved into the sale of slaves. ( James A. Picton, <i>ed.

</a><br><br><a name="n2"> [2] The <i>True Blue
</i> was commanded by Captain Berry in 1732; she may have been owned by Liverpool merchant John Pemberton. (See <a href="C32b28c.html"target="_wblank">Carter to John Pemberton
</a>, March 1 , 1732, and <a href="C32d12a.html"target="_wblank">Carter to Pemberton
</a>, April 12, 1732.)
</a><br><br><a name="n3"> [3] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.

</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] The tobacco inspection act of  1730 was introduced and steered through the legislature by Lieutenant Governor Sir William Gooch. " The "bill called for the inspection and bonding at public warehouses of all tobacco shipped abroad; for the destruction of all unacceptable tobacco; for standardization of the size of hogsheads . . . ; for maintenance of detailed records to prevent smuggling; and for the circulation of warehouse receipts as legal tender in lieu of tobacco itself. . . ." Gooch also managed to obtain approval of the act in England. It went into effect 1731 August 1.(<a href="Cbibl.html#B27">Billings. <i>et al. 
</i>  <i>Colonial Virginia: A History. 
</i> 
</a> pp. 236-39.)
</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] In the context of the letter, "cased" makes no sense for what Carter means is that each hogshread was opened, or <i>un
</i>cased," and the tobacco thoroughly inspected and "tumbled."
</a><br><br><a name="n6"> [6] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
