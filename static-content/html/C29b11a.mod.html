</b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. Because the draft extended near the bottom of the letter book page, the clerk did not separate the close from the text.

<br><br>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the heading on this draft.
</a>

<br><br>Carter wrote to his son-in-law, Mann Page, <a href="C29b11b.html"target="_wblank">this same day
</a> noting that he sends his letter to the governor by Charles, and has left it open so that Page can decide whether to send it or not. The minutes of a meeting of the Council held November 1, 1729, show that Charles did replace his brother as naval officer of the Rappahannock.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The office that Robert held was that of naval officer,  an official in the colony that reported to the Commissioners of Customs, a body that had first been established in 1663; the group was reorganized several times, especially after 1688. The board was "intrusted with collection of customs both in England and the colonies." The board helped write many of the instructions for colonial governors in collaboration with the Privy Council. "Their direct connection with the colonies was through the governors, who were instructed to correspond with the commissioners, and to send them, every three months, lists of clearances, and also reports of illegal trading. The governor's agent in matters of trade was the naval officer whom he was empowered to appoint, but who was required by the 7th and 8th William III to give security to the commissioners of customs."
