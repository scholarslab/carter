</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants Micajah and RichardPerry, 1717 December 10, 1717, noting that he will write more ofVirginia politics in his next as there is to be an Assembly beginningMarch 4th, and that he had fallen from a horse, badly displacing someof the bones in his arm, which will keep him at home during thewinter. He asks them to convey his "blessing" to his son John fromwhom he has not heard since John recovered from small pox; he hopesJohn "will learn his duty" to communicate more often.

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a fall from a horse I had <br>the misfortune to sprain mywrist <br>and am  sure  some of the bones <br>are displaced, which I fear will<br>keep me a house=bird all this<br>winter.

</center><br><br><i>Source copy consulted: 
</i>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparentlythere was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- nowlost -- from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. Asthey are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. 
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The return address, county, and colony have beenadded for clarity to this unheaded letter.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Richard Perry (d. 1720) was a partner with hisfather, Micajah, in the great London mercantilefirm of Perry and Lane. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B22">Price.  <i>Perry ofLondon. . . . 
</i> 
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] The copyist has clearly written "srip" but thisword does not appear in the  <i>Oxford English Dictionary.
</i> Presumably he miscopied from the letter book, possibly for "snip." Carter's complaint of not having received a letter from John isclear.
