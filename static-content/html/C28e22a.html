</center><br><br>me the clear proof you promised of the time of your wifes age, by Mrs. Pear=<br>sons Testimony and others. There is a further thing necessary to be done <br>before I can tell how to draw the Deeds that is to run the dividing line <br>between Colonel Mason and you with his Approbation &amp; Consent, and <br>to run the side lines of your 1610 Acres leaving a full division of the Fifth <br>part of the last <sup><font color="green">great

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find the Deeds of Jo: Waughs and Alexander <br>not to be worded alike Alexanders is not so Strong in favour of the <br>Surplus Lands as Jo: Waughs is, therefore I have the more reason to <br>desire the Sight of Jo: Waughs Deeds to his Several Brothers,
