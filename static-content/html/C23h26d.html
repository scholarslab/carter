</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, August 26, 1723, to send him the accounts (not present) for the management of John Lloyd's Virginia estate from 1714 forward, noting that Richard Meek's accounts have already been sent, that he met with George Turberville about his period of management, and that he cannot account for John Tayloe's three years as Tayloe no longer has his papers.
