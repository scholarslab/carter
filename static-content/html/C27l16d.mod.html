</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant John Falconar, December 16, 1727, to defend the quality of the tobacco that he produces, noting that it is "an easy matter for a merchant to give a despicable character of a mans goods when he renders him but a low sale." He also complains that Falconar has not sent his goods but has held them to be sent in one of the merchant's own ships. Carter writes that he understands why Falconar cannot undertake training of one of Carter's sons, and even though they have different religious faiths, he will continue to patronize the merchant as long as his tobacco is sold well, his good are purchased, and he is treated fairly.

In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price.
