</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to the colony's attorney general, [John Clayton], April 7, 1724, concerning his intention to bring an action in the General Court, as Clayton had recommended, to have the murderer, Thomas Glascock, declared an outlaw so that his lands may be granted as an escheat. He reminds Clayton that "Mr. Holloway and Mr Randall" are his attornies and will assist in the procedure for which he expects to pay Clayton as well.

</a> for the  murder   he had committed in order to his <br>Conviction and Attainting which According to the best In<br>formation I can get from my Books is absolutely Necessary <br>to be done before his Lands can be granted as <a href="Cbiodir.html#ES">Escheat
</a> In ans<br>wer you told me the Oyer and Terminer was not a proper court <br>to begin the prosecution in it must be done in the  General   Court <br>which drawing now very near I think it proper to put you in mind <br>of it that you may be prepared, <a href="Cbiodir.html#JH">Mr. Holloway

</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] "Oyer is French for to hear-i.e. hear in court or try; and terminer is French for to conclude. The words mean that the commissioners appointed are to hear and bring to an end all the cases in the county."  "In  I710  Queen Anne extended  the right  of habeas  corpus  to Virginia  and decreed  that  two courts  of oyer  and terminer  be held annually  to facilitate 'gaol  delivery.'  Such  courts  were  to sit the first  Tuesdays  of December  and June 7 ." "Free persons and indentured servants indicted for felony were tried in the General Court at Williamsburg if the justices found sufficient evidence to warrant a trial. Only slaves were tried in county courts for capital offenses. " (<xref to="www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/oyer-terminer.html"> <i>Dictionary of Phrase and Fable

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] "William Forrester had been murdered on November 5, 1723, by Thomas Glascock whose son Gregory was named as an accessory." Carter had noted Glascock's capture in his diary on November 13th: "Collo Barber acquaints me me he had Seizd Glascocks who had fled for Murther his Estate Coll Tarpley in the behalf of Glascocks Heir offers to Enter the Land as Escheat " The lands reverted to the proprietors, and Carter apparently managed them for some years for the benefit of Glascock's heirs; he later acquired title to the properties which are mentioned in his will.
