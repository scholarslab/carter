</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity.
</a><br><br>At the beginning of the second page of the draft of thisletter (folio 19r), the letter book paper is of a different type,much more absorbent, causing thicker lines and much bleed through. In addition, the outer edge of each page has damp stains that affectthe background color. However, some of the letters entered on thisabsorbant paper were written with an ink that was not as easilyabsorbed; while it has faded a good deal, it is often easier to read.
