</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to John Sterling and John Zuil, June 3, 1727, a newly-formed partnership, to send them a bill of lading (not present) for tobacco that he is shipping to them on board Captain Stephenson's ship. He notes that 3 hogsheads are sweet scented tobacco, and promises more business to the firm if they sell his tobacco at a good price.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Zuil was a merchant and was probably the ship's captain that Carter mentioned in his diary August 1, 1722. "Zuil Saild Gave me a Bottle Snuff."  Carter recorded a diary note about him the following year as well: December 30, 1723,  "mr Zuil &amp; man came back" [from church]. In what British city Zuil lived is not clear, but it may have been Liverpool because city directories of 1767-1773 list a John Zuil as a merchant, first inCable Street, and later, in King Street. This probably would have been a son of the man Carter knew, given the shorter lives at this period. ( <a href="http://www.yulefamily.com/newsletters/yule24.htm">"Yuil Family Newsletters,"

</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3]  There were two two major types of tobacco grown in Carter's day. Oronocco was "bulkier and coarser than sweetscented . . .  had a sharper leaf  'like a fox's ear,'" and was stronger in flavor "than sweetscented."
