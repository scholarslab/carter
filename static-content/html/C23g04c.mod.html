</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, July 4 and 6, 1723, to alert him to a number of bills of exchange drawn on him, and to cover an invoice (not present) for goods. Carter notes that he has not determined if the last shipment of shoes is as good as those of the previous year; he orders more which he asks Pemberton to have made for him. He closes by informing Pemberton that he will ship 40 or 50 hogsheads of tobacco on board the <i>Vine
</i>. In a post script dated July 6th, Carter reports his shipment of 40 hogsheads.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
