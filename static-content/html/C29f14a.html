send them to me that I may send them in Letters by the respective ships but <br>
if it happens Otherways, you may either deliver the bills of Lading to Colonel<br>
Page requesting him in my name to send one of them to the Merchants <br>
they are  Consignd  to in the Ship the Tobbo: is in rather  then  fail you must <br>
send a bill of Lading to each Mercht. by the proper ship, Acquainting the <br>

either Colonel Page or my Self have the bills of Lading -- 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="C29f14a.html#n8">Impost and Cocquet
</a> for these Tobbos: is due to the Masters <br>
upon their Signing the bills of Lading but I beleive they will be well enoug [h] <br> satisfyed  that it be mention'd in the bills of Lading the Impost and Cocq.  [not] <br>
being paid
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capt. Wills I am indebted to for a knot of <a href="C29f14a.html#n9"> Hamborrogh  li [ne] 
</a> <br>
and he sent me a  barrell  of strong Beer what he will charge for it I don't <br>
know he owes me by promise 30/ sterling for 10 hogsheads of Tobbo: I delive [red ] <br>

bringing home. You are to get this money of him after his Accot. --   [is ] <br>
paid or to discount it in my Impost either way as he pleas's -- 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Nelmes Accot. I think is right I did not know from <br>
whom I had the  Mulassus  I would have you pay him his ballance
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already told you I am in Capt. Bradbys Debt and <br>
directed you to get his Accot. and Send it me that I may order you to <br>him or if you pay him within orders it will be as well for I am not <br>
in the least Suspicious that he will be ingenerous in  overchargeing  <br>
me for any thing more than he would do if he and I were together <br>
in  Settleing  in the Accot. --

<br><br> The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft. 
</a>

<br><br>Carter sent this letter open to his son-in-law, Mann Page, <a href="C29f20a.html"target="_wblank">June 20, 1729
</a>, so that Page might review the instructions to Camp because Carter and Page managed jointly the affairs of Nathaniel Burwell's estate.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Rippon Hall had been Edmund Jening's estate in York County which he had acquired in 1687 from John and Unity West when it was named "Poplar Neck." Jenings's bad financial circumstances forced him to mortgage the property to Carter who eventually acquired title to it..( <a href="https://archive.org/stream/williammarycolle02tyle#page/n547/mode/2up/search/271"target="_wblank">"Notes and Queries."

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] John Falconar (d. <i>ca.
</i> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See <a href="C27g24d.html"target="_wblank">Carter's letter to Falconar

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] The <i> Micajah &amp; Philip
</i> was a large vessel of some 400 tons carrying a crew of 27. The captain's name varies from record to record as James Bradley or James Bradby. Thomas Jones wrote to his wife, then in England, concerning this ship in 1728, "The Micajah &amp; Philip that comes to James River is as good as the best Ships that Comes hither, but Bradby the master seems to be a little conceited and prodigal."
