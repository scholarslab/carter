</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Evans, March 6 and 2[?], 1724, to respond to sales reports which have pleased him but he expresses the hope that all his tobacco has been sold as he does not like having tobacco held for several years before it is sold. He chides Evans because he has not had an account current since 1717. He has 6 hogsheads of stripped tobacco he will send the mechant if Adam Graves will take it even if not consigned to William Dawkins, Graves' owner. In a lengthy postscript dated March 2?, 1724, Carter adds that he is sending 10 hogsheads of straight laid tobacco in the <i>Bailey.
</i> He orders goods for a head overseer, and winter shoes and hats for his two sons at home, as well as coffee for himself.
