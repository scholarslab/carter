<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his grandson, Lewis Burwell, June 26, 1729, then at Eton, to chide him for his infrequent and short letters and inform him that he has approved Micajah Perry's choice of tutor at Cambridge; he adds that Lewis's  expenses must be reduced, and that his family is well.
