</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, July 13,1720, concerning a bill of exchange that he thought he had drawn onPemberton but he  has now remembered was drawn on anothermechant. He has drawn on Pemberton for &pound;80 payable to EdmundJenings. He reports that Captain Enoch Robinson had offered him&pound;8 per ton freight when Robinson first arrived, but Robinsonnow has so much business that he wishes to charge Carter &pound;9which is not acceptable and Carter will not ship by Robinson.
