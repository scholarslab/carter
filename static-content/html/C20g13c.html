</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his son John, then in London studyinglaw, on July 13, 1720, complaining at length about John's expenses,particularly in persuading Micajah Perry to advance him funds beyondhis allowance. He states that if John deceives him again about theexpenses, he will no longer accept John's word about the managementof his affairs in London. He continues by refuting John's claim thatJohn Randolph has maligned John, and adds that Randolph never worebetter clothes that he has observed although his acquaintance withRandolph is slight. Randolph's politics and his were so opposed,Randolph being "a rank Torey a Proud, humble Parasite a fawningSycophant to his Patron," that he had not hired Randolph again aftera year of retaining him, and now finds Randolph involved in almostall cases he has lost. Robert continues that his lawsuit againstThomas Wise should soon be concluded, and that he will writeseparately concering "Mr. Lee's Settlemt. &amp; Sr. Robt. Raymond's opinion upon the Case." He writes John that "Mr. Cary'sLawsuit is not Yett determin'd" and gives some details of the case,and notes that some poor familys that "whose Ancestors before themhave liv'd &amp; Dyed in quiet possession of these Lands" are likelyto be hurt by the suit, adding that he has a closer claim to thelands than the person from whom Cary acquired  because they hadbelonged to his niece. He instructs John to visit Cary and make himacquainted with these facts, reporting that he had made offers toCary through his lawyers to buy the lands in question, and directingJohn to keep in close contact, pressing Cary for his "LowestDemands." He concludes by criticising John for not mentioning hisbrothers who are in England at school, and reports that the family iswell.
