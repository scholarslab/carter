</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, September 30, 1723, to order 12 dozen "Mens Irish Stockings" to be added to those he  has already ordered. He notes that he will send 20 or 30 hogsheads by Captain Eaton if he can get it ready quickly, and will send "at least 30 more" in the <i>Content,
</i> hoping that the new act of Parliament will drive up prices for stemmed tobacco that reaches market before it goes into effect.
