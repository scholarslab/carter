</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to the trustee of the Fairfax estate,William Cage, of County Kent, England, July 9, 1724, detailing his success in collecting &pound;200 due the proprietor from Edmund Jenings, the former Virginia agent. He notes that he has received the sum by threatening a law suit and taking a mortgage, and Lord Fairfax and Cage may collect the money from Micajah Perry in London. In order to collect a further &pound;100 on their behalf, he needs more evidence from them, but he notes Jenings' deteriorating mental and physical health. He reports a secret survey he has had made of the Brent Town grant that will not be binding on anyone but which will open some land to grants. He turns to the law suit he has brought in the colony to determine the proprietor's right to certain fines, fees, etc., and requests that Cage show the proprietors' grant to the Attorney and Solicitor General and send their opinions to the colony where they will bear much weight with the court. He asks for instructions about an appeal to the King in Council should the case be lost in the colony.

</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>July 9th. 1724
</u> <br> <br>Sr.<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your favour of the 2d. of  December   came safe to <br>me at last after some doubting of its miscarriage I was glad <br>to hear of <a href="Cbiodir.html#TF">his Lordships
</a> health beg you will do me the honour <br>in making my compliments to him letting him know how <br>much I am his Lordships most obedient humble servt:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pleasure to me to find both his Lordship &amp; <br>your self under so much satisfaction with my management <br>of your affairs. I have now got  paid   into my hands two hun=<br>dred pounds more of your debt from <a href="Cbiodir.html#EJ"> Colonel    Jenings  
</a> I shall not <br>magnify my merit in getting this mony for you, yet must <br>take the liberty to tell you it was not easily come at and nothing <br>less  than   hanging a severe law suit over his head would bring <br>him into the humour of doing you justice, and at last it is <br> hauled   out of a Mortgage that he  has   made for the security <br>of some other persons. This two hundred pounds I have  ordered   <br><a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr Perry
</a> to pay when you are pleased to call for it but <br>I shall take it as a favour if you are not too quick upon <br>him  until   he is in cash upon the sale of a large quantity <br>of Tobacco  he  has   of mine in his hands.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the remaining balance between you and  Colonel   <br> Jenings   it remains yet unadjusted; I in your behalf de=<br>manding one hundred twenty nine pounds for want of <br>vouchers and he insisting (taking advantage of your letter <br>to his son) that there is only twenty nine pounds behind; <br>for the balance of this  Account   when  it is    Settled   as well as for <br>the security of a larger sum he  owes   to myself I am let into <br>the tail of a Mortgage which must confess I do not like very <br>well, however  it is   the best I could get and I believe the best <br>he can give for as I stand informed he  has   not a negroe <br>nor an Acre of land but is under Mortgage to some person <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>or another Now it is necessary for you to send me the clearest proof <br>you have of the nonpayment of this hundred pounds to take <br>the force of your expressions to his son and if you can send <br>your own testimony how far your knowledge goes about the <br>nonpayment of this hundred pounds to my <a href="C24g09a.mod.html#n1">Lady Fairfax 
</a><br>it may not be amiss;  Colonel    Jenings   is at this time under <br>so great a decay both of mind and body that it is expected by <br>all he cannot hold out much longer
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have got some lines run about the Lands tht. <br>I think must be deemed to be what the <a href="Cbiodir.html#BT">Brenton Grant
</a> <br>designed including something more than thirty thousand <br>Acres but this I was forced to do without noise both <a href="C24g09a.mod.html#n2">Mrs. Brent
</a> <br>and the inhabitants about this place and within these <br>bounds  threatening   to stop the surveyer whenever he came &amp; <br>indeed  waylaid   him on purpose but he had the luck to pass <br>them before They were aware. Now I cannot conclude this <br>private survey will be binding either to you or to the Proprietors <br>of the Brenton Grant however it will have this good effect <br>to lay open a large quantity of back Land toward the Moun=<br>tains that people have been hitherto  afraid   to Meddle <br>with being kept in  awe   by that Grant -- 
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your cause with the Crown upon the words of <br>your Grant is still depending  until   the opinions of the Attorney <br>and Solicitor General can be had this method both our <br><a href="Cbiodir.html#JC3">Attorney General
</a> and my self with the advice of the Lawyers <br>I have  employed   came readily into and if  you'll   please to <br>produce your Grant to these great men &amp; send me their <br>opinions upon the Clause wherein is given to you All and <br>all manner of fines  <S><font color="red">&amp;

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I desire you will let me have your full <br>orders if the cause should go against you here whether <br>you will have me carry it before the King in Council by an appeal

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br>This text is a recipient's copy sealed with Carter's arms and with the following on the conjoined address leaf:  To Wm. Cage Esqr. | Of Milgate | In the Parish of Bearshead | In the County of Kent --  | To be left at Mr. Micaj Perrys | Of | London |Per the Spotswood | Capt. Bagwell. It is endorsed in Cage's hand, "July 9th 1724 | Coll Carter."  Carter has signed, indicated here by the use of bold italics, which does not reveal the size of his signature which is at least twice the height of the clerk's hand.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Catherine Culpeper (d. 1719) was the widow of the fifth Lord Fairfax (d. 1710). From her father, the 2nd Lord Culpeper, she had inherited about 1689 his five-sixths interest in the Northern Neck Proprietary in Virginia. Lord Fairfax had consulted Micajah Perry about the affairs of the Proprietary, and Perry had recommended Robert Carter to be the Virginia agent in 1702. He held the post until 1710 when Lady Fairfax transferred the agency to Edmund Jenings with Thomas Lee as the deputy agent. When she died in 1719, she bequeathed her Virginia property to her son Tom, but she made Wiliam Cage and Edward Filmer, trustees of the proprietary. Filmer soon died, and Cage, a kinsman of the 6th Lord Fairfax, became the sole trustee. From his grandmother, Margaret Lady Culpeper, the 6th Lord Fairfax inherited the other one-sixth of the Proprietary. Cage consulted Perry, and Robert Carter was again made agent in 1721, holding the post until his death ten years later. (For sources, see those listed at the end of the <a href="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/#Northern Neck"target="_wblank"> discussion of the Proprietary
</a> on the home page.)
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Mrs. Brent was the mother of George Brent who inherited from his grandfather, George Brent ([d. 1699] of "Woodstock," Stafford County, the "resident partner in Virginia" for the development of the Brent Town grant by Nicholas Hayward), the family's claim to a portion of the Brent Town grant. She was a considerable thorn in Carter's side concerning the grant and its boundaries. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks. . . .
