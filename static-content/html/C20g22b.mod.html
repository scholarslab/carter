</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants, Micajah and RichardPerry, July 22, 1720, concerning bills of exchange and tobaccoshipped on board the <i>Carter,
</i> including 9hogsheads belonging to Daniel McCarty. He notes that he has receiveda report of sales they had sent with Capt. Friend, and that he ispleased with the price fetched. He turns to his son John's pleas ofrepentance about his spending and attention to his studies and statesthat he will not remonstrate further if John keeps to his promises.His debt from Edward Hastewell still disturbs him, and he hopes thePerrys will assist John Bashford. He concludes with a remark aboutthe South Sea stock, Parliament's "Falling into a Design that Threatens ruin to the nation, " and that all thingspolitical are presently calm in the colony.
