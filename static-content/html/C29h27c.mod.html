<br><br>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft. Carter has added the close in his own hand as is indicated by the use of bold italics.

</a> Bradley owned the <i>Welcome,

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] There was a ferry over the Piankatank River near Berkeley Island operated by Bailey Seaton that Carter often refers to when describing trips to Williamsburg. The Seaton property is noted on the Fry-Jefferson map as on the Piankatank in Gloucester County.
</a>

 <br><br><a name="n5">[5] Henry Sweet was captain of the <i>Chester
</i>, a ship thst traded to Barbados and Virginia. ( Survey Report 04590 summarizing Public Record Office Class: T 38/264."Treasury, Departmental Accounts-Barbadoes, Journal of 4 1/2% Duties, 1730." "The following ships and cargoes were bound for Virginia." Henry Sweet is shown as master of the <i>Chester

</a>; and  Survey Report 07233 summarizing Hampshire Record Office Class Wyndham 1725-1753. "Invoices and Sundry Accounts of Henry Wyndham, June 1725-September 1753." Included are records of several voyages of the <i>Chester

<br><br><a name="n6">[6]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company they named Frying Pan to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.

<br><br><a name="n7">[7] "The building of Rosewell was begun in 1725 by Mann Page I (1691-1730), who married in 1718 Judith Carter, the daughter of Robert "King" Carter. . . . It was Page's intention to build a home that would rival or exceed the newly completed Governor's Palace in Williamsburg in size and luxury.  . . . The primary construction materials were brick, marble and mahogany, some of which was imported from England. Architectural historians believe that the 12,000-square-foot (1,100 m2) house, double the size of the Governor's Palace, may have been designed by Mann Page himself. Larger than any home built in colonial Virginia, Rosewell probably owed its design to the London townhouses built to the stricter codes following the Great Fire of London. . . . The Rosewell Mansion was destroyed by fire in 1916. Today, a largely undisturbed historic ruin, the site has been the subject of archaeological work. . . ."
