</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Edmund Jenings, Jr., March 8, 1721, who has been acting for his father who had held the lease of the Northern Neck proprietary prior to Carter's assumption of it. Carter disagrees with Jenings about the handling of the lease, especially in their approach to escheats, and in the issuance of deeds. He chides Jenings about the handling of the records, and concludes that he will not fight "a paper controversie with You" but if Jenings will do him justice, he will not pursue the questions he has. He deleted from the draft a sentence about erasures in the records of the dates on which deeds were issued.

</i> <br><br>Mar. 8th 1720/21<br><br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yors. by <a href="Cbiodir.html#GT"> Captain   Turbervile
</a> I have  <S><font color="red">and find
</font>
</S> Your  notions &amp; <br>mine  <S><font color="red">very much 
</font>
</S> differ  about   Justice in the business of the <a href="Cbiodir.html#ES">Escheat
</a> <br>which I shall always Study to do to every body but must be  allowed   <br>to make my own reason the measure of my actions &amp; not another <br>mans, The right of Escheats arises to the <a href="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/#Northern Neck"target="_wblank">Proprietors
</a> no doubt from <br>the time of the dying  seized  without heirs, but the right in the Propri=<br>=etors to the Composition commences from the passing the deed <br>&amp; I must strangely alter  in
</i> my  <S><font color="red">notion
</font>
</S>   opinion
</i> before I shall be  <S><font color="red">brot. to be
</font>
</S>   perswaded
</i> to  <br>believe  it is   <S><font color="red">right
</font>
</S>   Just
</i> for me  <S><font color="red">so
</font>
</S>  to do  otherways.
</i> Your  distinction that I must pass <br> <S><font color="red">the
</font>
</S>  Deeds as I am Agent for the Proprietors &amp; not in  <S><font color="red">their 
</font>
</S>   my own
</i> name <br>there's no weight in It that I can see, I believe no person <br> concerned   in their affairs will pass any deed in their own <br>names so I shall Still lay the Justice of the poor man's case <br>at Your  Door,  let   the right of Escheats fall whe re
</i> they will <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2
</i>-
</center><br><br>when I am to make over the Proprietors right, I shall Claim <br> <S><font color="red">the right to 
</font>
</S> the Consideration
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not well remember what I said to You about the deeds <br>that remain in the office unpaid for but if I did Demand <br>them It was upon the Expectation that they never would be paid <br>for and than I am sure  it is   highly reasonable that the Proprie=<br>=tors should be made acquainted with It,  <S><font color="red">&amp; . . . 
</font>
</S> that <br>they may fall upon a right method to come at their rents &amp; <br>that must be by cancelling &amp; regranting, as for the Consideration <br>if it is to be had is <a href="Cbiodir.html#EJ"> Colonel   Jennings'
</a>  <S><font color="red">right
</font>
</S>  I make no question <br>about, but if not I think in Generous Justice he ought to return <br>the Deeds to the office and I believe he will be of the Same <br>opinion, but what say You to the last Rent Rolls, be=<br>=lieve  you'll   hardly Scruple owning they belong to the office  <S><font color="red">and 
</font>
</S>  nor <br>the  plats   neither as many as there was, Indeed I always <br> thought   the Surveys  belonged   to the owners of the Lands,  &amp; we are  gone   that way is well enough
</i> I can give <br>You convinceing reasons there was no probability, the office <br>Should remain where it was, but that in Its proper time <br>You are the only  fit   person to make a list of the Deeds that <br>You have passed since the 29th of  September   1719,  <S><font color="red"> &amp; of all other things that . . . to . . . in my head<br>
</i> I cannot Expect a<br>right Information from any Mortal living beside considering<br>how many  erasures   there appear to be in the book in the <br>very place where the Deeds are Dated, how far Your  Clerk<br>may have been  concerned   in this I cant pretend to know
</font>
</S> &amp; to give me  satisfaction   <br>in all other things, that seem to want an Interpretation <br>Do me fair and open Justice and I Shall be easy and not desirous <br>to meddle in  Colonel    Jenings's   time, as I dont take You to be <br> infallible   So I am  far   from pretending to be so my Self. <br>when I entered upon the office, I had a very dark pattern to <br>follow. I  preceded   You and I hope You will allow me to <br>say  without offence
</i> that I Should be very sorry if my  record
</i> books had been kept <br>in that  <S><font color="red">Dark
</font>
</S>  mysterious  Immethodical
</i> manner as  <S><font color="red">You have made <br>the method of
</font>
</S> Yors. is, I shall not further enter into a <br>paper  contoversy   with You, if amicable ways won't <br>do; It's none of my fault, The Proprietors right &amp; mine <br>too must be come at some way or other, I wish You a cheap-<br>er bargain in plank than I can afford You, &amp; am Sir
