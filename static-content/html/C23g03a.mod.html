</i> and reporting that he had earlier sent 20 of his and 10 of the the Burwell's estate on board the <i>Booth.
</i> He encloses an invoice (not present) for goods and gives instructions about their delivery. He sends some bills of exchange (not present) and asks that Colmore send his tobacco to an early market. His later post script notifies Colmore of other bills of exchange.
