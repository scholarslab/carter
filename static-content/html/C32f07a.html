</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, June 7, 1732, to report on the stories in the country that the tobacco crop is small and that ships are having a hard time finding complete cargoes which, he hopes, may affect prices for the tobacco already on its way to England. Mr. Bradley's ship has not arrived, and there are many rumors of Bradley's financial difficulties. The assembly is working on amending the tobacco inspection law.

</a> I have little to say now only to mention the Reports that are <br>very hot among us. Capt. Bradby of the <a href="C32f07a.html#n3"> Spotswood 
</a> tells me he does not <br>expect to get above four hundred hogsheads, &amp; speaks of several more of the York <br>ships under his Circumstances &amp; Reports from James River as much the <br>same. <a href="C32f07a.html#n4">Captain Dove
</a> gives you an accot himself of his Circumstances. The <br><a href="C32f07a.html#n5">Outport Ships

</a> Ship for our River. If she  doth  not come it will be some ad= <br>vantage to your  Bailey.  I have already hinted to you the harsh stories that are <br>spread about all the  Countrey  of Mr. Bradley's Circumstances. I  chear  myself <br>up with Hopes they are not true. If any such thing shou'd happen I shall be a <br>great Sufferer; and I believe many Gentlemen in James River will have their <br>Share. I have already told you how fond our  Countrey  is of the <a href="C32f07a.html#n7"> Tobaco  Law.
