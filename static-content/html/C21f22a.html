Peter Hedgeman -- <br>
 

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unexpected Death of Yor. father was very Shocking<br>
to me. I heartily wish he had  mett  with a more natural fate, he  hath  bin <br>
a very great delinquent of late from my business much contrary to the <br>
Articles he was under to me, had he bin in the Discharge of his Duty &amp; at the <br>
place he ought to have made his home he might have bin a living <br>
man at this day, I Shall be willing to do him Justice for the time he <br>
was in my Service, You have done very well to go to the Sevl. Qrs. &amp; to take <br>
a written Accot. of my Stocks and Goods there, I have Imploy'd one

</center><br><br>
John Johnson  [who]    hath  bin my Overseer for some years to succeed Your <br>
Father as my Genl Overseer to him I would have You give up the Accs <br>
You have taken &amp; I would also have You not remove Yor. Fathers <br>
bed but  lett  him have the use of It,  till  he can  gett  up one of his <br>
own which will be by the next Sloop that comes, I hope You have <br>
follow'd my orders, in Marking &amp; weighing my Tobo. &amp;c, and that the Sloop <br>
is  dispatcht  away before now, besides the Goods  tht.  went in the last Sloop <br>
Yor. Father had a great many other Goods of mine under his Care <br>
which I Expect You will take care to See deliver'd to the affores'd John<br>
=son, The greater Yor. diligence is in what relates to me, to more Induce <sup><font color="green">me
</i>
</font>
</sup> <br>
I shall have to be  easie  in repect to Yor.Fathers negligences that he <br>
 hath  bin guilty of in my business altogether contrary to the Conditions <br>
that were between us,
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Yor. proposal of Succeeding Yor.Father in my busi<br>=ness It appears to be a very odd Thought in You, You must have some more <br>
Years over Yor. head &amp; a greater Share of Experience in the world as well <br>
as to  lett  It be Seen what  cources  You will fall upon in the managemt. <br>
of  Yorself  &amp; Yor. own business, before any Judicious person will think <br>
You capable of Such a Charge as mine is, what kindness will  lye  in my <br>
way in respect to the long  Imploy  Yor. father had under me <br>
I shall be ready to do you who am 
</p>

<br>Yor. Friend

He became a lawyer, and "long represented Stafford in the Assembly, and was one of the Crown Commissioners for the location of the Northern Neck boundary in 1746."

He had been Carter's chief overseer in the falls area, but had died recently apparently in an accident. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks. . . .
