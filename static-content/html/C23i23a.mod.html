</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Cage, the trustee of Lady Fairfax's estate, writes to London merchant, Micajah Perry, September 23, 1723, concerning the affairs of the proprietary estate in Virginia, commenting specifically on a "packet" he has received from the estate's agent, Robert Carter. He informs Perry that Lord Fairfax will be willing to press the proprietor's interest before the Board of Trade as Carter wishes, and that he assumes that the opinions of the Attorney and Solicitor General must be obtained again, as Carter already has. He sends all the papers relative to the case that he has received from Carter, and asks Perry to let him or Lord Fairfax know when Fairfax should appear before the Board. In March, he will be in London, and will then need the rent money as Lord Fairfax's 3rd sister will come of age and he must pay what is due to her from the estate. In a post script, he states that he cannot comment on Carter's statement about Edmund Jenings's accounts for rent for the proprietary until he has seen Mr. Adamson, but the Jenings account is new and strange to him.

</a> by reason of his post in the Army is seldom at home &amp; I had not the <br>Opportunity of Communicating the Contents of Colonel Carters packet to  me  until   the other day<br>he leaves it too much to me who really am  Ignorant of Merchants Affairs but<br>if I understand Colonel Carter right the business he depends on my  Lord  Fairfax for is <br>to soliciit the Board of Trade (where he has an Interest) to forward their report to the <br>Governor of Virginia wch  Colonel Carter hopes will be according to the Opinion of the  Attorney   <br>&amp; Soliciator general who have (as he says) given it in his Favour &amp; I hope will <br>Do so again.We both beg of you that  you'll   do what is  desired   by Colonel Carter in <br>this affair of wch we are both Ignorant all but of soliciting parts to the Board wch  Lord   <br>Fairfax is willing to undertake as soon as it comes before them &amp; desires likewise <br> you'll   give him or me Notice when It's  fit   for him to Apply to them for  I suppose <br>you must again have the Opinion of the  Attorney   &amp; Solicitor  General   to be laid before the <br>Board.
