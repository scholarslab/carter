</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carter, Robert Carter's oldest son, writes from London on his father's business to inform William Cage, September 20, 1722, that he has received from his father bills of exchange drawn by Edmund Jenings on merchant Micajah Perry. They are to pay in part some protested bills of Jenings's, in part some more of Jenings's debt, and in part of his father's rent due to Cage as trustee of Lord Fairfax, the proprietor of the Northern Neck. He wishes to have Cage discharge both his father and Micajah Perry, and to meet Cage should he come to London "purchasing my Father's Particular part of the Quit Rents."

</center><br> London.  20. September 1<u>722
</u> <br><br> <br>Sir,<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just now  reciev'd  from my Father three<br>Bills of Exchange for six hundred and sixty Pounds, drawn<br>on <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP">Mr: Perry
</a> at sixty days sight by Coll:  Jennings  of<br>Virginia. Four hundred are  design'd  to make good those<br>Bills which were  return'd  Protested the last year, two hun-<br>dred as a further part of his Debt and the remaining<br>sixty You are to recieve in part of what is due to You<br>from my Father. Mr. Perry has seen the Bills and<br>would willingly accept them, but He as well as myself think<br>it necessary that You should first give us a discharge to <br>secure Coll.  Jennings  and my Father from any damage which<br>may arise from the Protested Bills; for  tho'  they have been<br>sent from England above nine months, we know not how they<br>are they  dispos'd  of, my father having never yet received <br> 'em . I have a long time  wish'd  for an opportunity of talking <br> with You about purchasing my Father's Particular part of the <br> <a href="C22i20a.html#n1">Quit Rents,
</a> and if you come to Town between this and the tenth<br>of October shall be very glad to wait on You. In the mean time<br>I shall be every day at the Widow's Coffee house in Deve-<br>reux Court near the Temple, and always ready to receive <br>Your Commands.
</p><br>I am, Sir<br>Your most Obedient<br>humble Servant<br><br><i><hi rend="bold"><i>JOHN CARTER

</a><br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.
