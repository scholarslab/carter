</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, December 12, 1727, complaining that he has not been allowed a discount upon the fees for 90 hogsheads sent for sale. He comments on Perry's charges for "Collo: Bolling's commission," for "Mr. Blew the lawyer," and on affairs of the estates of Nathaniel Burwell, Merchants Hundred, and the Lloyds. He concludes that he is pondering what to do with the &pound;1500 bank annuity which he assumes has come to Perry's hands because of the Act of Parliament.

</center><br>Mr: Micajah Perry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rappa [hannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]
</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Decembr: 12th: 1727<br><br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the favour of your two letters of the 23d of  August  <br>&amp; 9th of  October  &amp; find I am not to have the Discounts upon my 90 hogsheads allowed <br>me without the satisfaction of meeting with a Convincing reason why <br>you deprive me of it. Admitting you are right in saying that the state of <br>my Cash in your hands at that time (which I can by no means agree to) <br>was too low yet seeing the circumstances of my Affairs  has  been <br>larger both before &amp; since than the calls of my Occasions a much lon-<br>ger time than the  disbursements   you  were out of pocket for me I can <br>not in my way of reasoning see why I might not have  <S><font color="red"> not

</font>
</S>  Expected the <br>same  benefit  from your money as you reap from mine This part of <br>my Argument you have not thought fit to give me any answer to <br>how  far  this proceeding is consistent with the strictest justice &amp; <br>honour I Shall leave to your consideration
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="C27l12e.mod.html#n1"> Colonel  Bolling's
</a> commission you agree to allow me <br>I suppose before this <a href="Cbiodir.html#JR">Mr. Randolph
</a>  has   paid  into your hands on my <br>Account  the Effects of the 67 hogsheads which I am well satisfyed he was <br>ordered by  Colonel  Bolling to Do having in my hands the bills of La=<br>ding with such Directions upon them
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am under no apprehension but  you   paid  to Mr Blew <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</font>
</S>  a great de [al]
</i> <br>&amp; his Solicitation I had no Occasion of because the matter was deter<br>mined before by the Kings instruction which <a href="Cbiodir.html#HD"> Colonel  Drysdale
</a> was <br>pleased to conceal to say no more of it
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are pleased to own Your Self mistaken in not <br>allowing the Discounts on the <a href="Cbiodir.html#MH">Merchants hundred

</a> Estate Credit for it thus  far  in part I am <br> satisfied  but the broken Accot of Paget it seems is still to stand a dead <br>weight upon that Estate. You  <S><font color="red">are pleased to
</font>
</S>  Observe that some have <br>thought proper to bear that loss with a view to recommend themselves bu [t]

</i> <br>forbear to call to your remembrance the methods of your father &amp; <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP">Gra [nd]
</i><br>father
</a> who never charged a broken Account to any man in the long course <br>of their business, one would think if other mens Examples are no rule for <br> you  to theirs at least you would pay a venerable regard. I am obliged to you <br>for your kind promises that in respect of the long correspondence that <br>I have had subsisting in your family  <S><font color="red">shall always prompt you
</font>
</S>   You will be ready
</i> to do <br>me all the good Offices in your power which as I receive them I shall <br>never fail in suitable acknowledgements
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now look forward herein I send you my Accot of <br>the  disbursements  upon the <a href="Cbiodir.html#LL">LL's 
</a>Estate for the Year 1726 it  is

</center><br><br>	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a former letter from you &amp; indeed by the Act <br>of Parliament for the paying of the  Annuities  I must conclude <br>my  bank  Annuity of &pound;1500. is  <S><font color="red">now
</font>
</S>   paid  into your hands my next <br>consideration must be how to employ this money to Advantage I almost <br>doubt should I propose to let it  lie  in your hands at an interest of 4  percent  <br>you would reject it I will pause a while perhaps if  you  design to say any <br>thing to it  Until  I may have your Answer if you will not meddle with <br>it my present thoughts are to turn it into  bank  Stock.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now to remember there is two years rent due <br>to the <a href="C27l12e.mod.html#n3"> Proprietors 
</a> if  you  have not  paid  any since the last Accot: but I hope <br>you have  paid  one half of it at least &amp; if you have  paid  it all I shall not <br>be disturbed provided you have Deducted <a href="Cbiodir.html#EJ"> Colonel  Jennings's
</a> debt <br> although  if the last years rent be not  paid   until  March next the  proprietors  will have no reason to complain <br>I shall Close here &amp;  <S><font color="red">now
