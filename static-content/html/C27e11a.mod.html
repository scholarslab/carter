</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, May 11, 1727, to  enclose bills of exchange and lading (not present) and report that he expects to send the tobacco and letter on Tucker's ship, the <i>Princess Amelia.
</i> He reports the arrival of the <i>Portland,
</i> another of Tucker's ships, and thanks him for the accounts of sales. He notes reports in the colony of fighting because of the seige of Gibralter. He adds in a post script that he has lost many slaves recently, has had to buy new ones, and has drawn on Tucker in payment.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1"> [1] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
