Alderman Perry<br>
 
<br>Sir -- <br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of your  Letters you desire me to Send you <br>Accounts  of the  Disbursements  upon the <a href="Cbiodir.html#LL">LLs
</a> Estate from  Year  1711 to 1718 <br>this is a very hard task and it is Impossible for me at this distance of <br>time to produce all the Vouchers to  those  Accots: You cannot Expect <br><sic corr="we"> we  [sic]  are as regular in our books as you  Merchants  are whose business <br>it is to transact Affairs for other men had your  <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP">Grandfather
</a> &amp; Father <br>made any Exceptions to any Articles in  those  Accots: it was then in <br>my Power to have  Justified  them in every <a href="C29d10a.mod.html#n1">Punctilio
</a>, but Seeing <br>they have  Passed  and I have had Credit for them so long ago I cant <br>think it my business at this time of day to be  Concerned  about them <br>however that I may give you all the light in my Power I now Trans=<br>mit you all the <S><font color="red">se
</font>
</S>   Copys of these
</i> Accots: you desire  even down to 1721
</i> as I find them in my books <br>Together with what Vouchers I have, <a href="C29d10a.mod.html#n2">Colonel Tayloe's
</a>  Tobacco  Account  for <br>the Year 1713 I Send you but his Account  for the Year 1712  for 9060 pounds  Tobacco 
</i> I can find <br>nothing of  <S><font color="red">for 960 pounds
</font>
</S>  and I am very well  Satisfied  there is no <br>footstep of it to be found with him. You have here a  Tobacco   Account 
</i> for the  Year  <br>1715 where you will find the Debts that Year paid out of the Crops, You <br>are pleased to tell me they are very  Clamorous  against these Accounts  <br>and <a href="C29d10a.mod.html#n3">Tax me
</a> of Several Indirect Practices I can only answer they are <br>under very wrong Informations I can very well  Justify  my Integrity <br>and Justice in this whole Affair and that I do not deserve those Severa [l]  <br>Censures they are Pleased to Vent against me, The Persons I have  employed  <br>more Immedately in the Care of this estate are Colonel Tayloe, <a href="Cbiodir.html#GT"> Captain   Tuberville 
</a> <br>and Mr. <a href="Cbiodir.html#RM">Richard Meeks 
</a>all Still living to be Appealed to, to run its Part=<br> [i] culars to answer every  malicious  little  Story  that ma [y]  Perhaps have been <br>hatched by Some over Officious Persons, would be En [. . .]  I wear a <br>higher Character in your  Esteem and the Esteem   [ . . .]

Then to think me capable of mean  Pitful l Arts and frauds for a <br>little gain to my Self, I thank God from the interest of my money I cant <br>charge my Self with no Such thing.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have so often <a href="C29d10a.mod.html#n4">inculcated
</a> to you the meanest of the Plan s
</i>: <br>how much the Lands  <S><font color="red">there
</font>
</S>  were  <S><font color="red">wore
</font>
</S>   overstocked  with Slaves, how Im=<br>possible it was to make tolerable Crops with them and how absolutely <br>necessary it was  to find more Lands for the better half of these Slaves &amp;ca: <br>that I Shall not repeat any of these things but refer you to abundance <br>of former Letters which are full of this Subject, I Shall observe one <br>thing to you which I think proper for  your  Information when I  Entered  <br>upon this Estate <a href="C29d10a.mod.html#n5"> Quit  rents
</a> was paid for 4,000 and odd  Acres  of Land, the <br>mistake I was under for Sometime   [<i>sic
</i>]
</i> but when I came to be better Acq=<br>uainted with the Several Tracts I could find but 2330  Acres  of which <a href="Cbiodir.html#RC">Mr. <br>Carys
</a> Survey being a much Elder Grant took away bet we n 4 &amp; 500  Acres  <br>which has reduced  these  Lands to 1900  &amp; odd
</i>  Acres  When this Estate was  delivered  into <br>my hands the  houses  upon the  Several  Plantations <br>were so  gone  to decay and out of repair that <br> we  were forced to make all new buildings &amp;  we  also then Seated two new <br>Plantations out of the Woods this made the Charge run high for the first Years, but the <br>Crops then  answered  very well while the Lands were fresh
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon Consideration of the great trouble I have been at <br> through  this whole affair in Your  Grandfather Fathers and your  own time <br>which you cannot but be very Sensible of in a great measure your Self <br>I hope according to yours and their promises you will take care upon <br>the passing your  Accounts  that I am  allowed  a Suitable Salary I have said <br>so much of this to all of you already and make Such Continual Claim <br>that this seems hardly necessary to you Now I am 
</p>

Since  writing  the above I have accidentally fallen on Some <br>rough Accounts  between Colonel Tayloe &amp; I which will Serve for Vouchers for the <br>Year 1712 Also a  mixed  Account    <S><font color="red">between him and I

</b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. Carter addresses Perry as "Alderman" because Perry had been elected an alderman of London in February 1728. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B22">Price.  <i>Perry of London. . . . 
</i>  p. 7.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Punctilo means "a minute detail of action or conduct; a nicety of behaviour, ceremony, or honour; a small or petty formality. Also: a hair-splitting or fastidious objection; a scruple."  One suspects Cater meant the hair splitting. (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.

</i>  pp. 115-16.

</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Carter had extensive knowledge of the law, and may have used "tax" here to mean "To estimate or determine the amount of . . . to assess. . . ."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Inculcated means "to endeavour to force (a thing) into or impress (it) on the mind of another by emphatic admonition, or by persistent repetition; to urge on the mind, esp. as a principle, an opinion, or a matter of belief; to teach forcibly. . . ."   (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] Quit rent was the term used for "a (usually small) rent paid by a freeholder . . .  in lieu of services which might otherwise be required; a nominal rent paid (esp. in former British colonial territories to the Crown) as an acknowledgement of tenure," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
