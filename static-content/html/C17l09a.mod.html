</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his attorney John Holloway, December 9,1717, concerning claims by Edmund Jenings that Carter had placed afence on his property. Carter states that his fence is in the sameplace as the land's former owner, Mrs. Whaley, had had her fence, butif Jenings can convince him that the fence is misplaced, he willacknowledge it. He continues that the serious injury to his rightwrist will probably prevent his attendance at the next session of theAssembly which he understands is to meet in March. The wrote againstthe Lees has been received and he will make use of it if the occasionarises. Some of Carter's comments about a proposal by Holloway for"an equal distribution of Mr. Lee's debts among his creditors" havebeen omitted by the copyist, and Carter concludes by thankingHolloway for his services.

</i> <br> December   9th1717.<br> To John Holloway                                              <br>Sir,<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give you my kind thanks <br>for your two late letters.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for <a href="Cbiodir.html#EJ"> Colonel  Jennings'
</a> pretentions <br>ofmy <notetarget="n1"> pales 
</a> standing upon hisland <br>it is a thing purely novel to me. If <br>I mistake not,they stand on the <br>same place where the former <siccorr="pales">pails [sic]  <br>didwhich he himself was the <br>seller of to<a href="C17l09a.mod.html#n2">Mrs. Whaley
</a>: and why I <br>must not holdthe same ground that she <br>didI can see no reason.
</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our <a href="C17l09a.mod.html#n3">Assembly
</a> it seems is to sit<br>down early in March. At this<br>time my right arm,  although  almost <br>six weeks ago hurt,continues very <br>useless to me. Some ofthe bones of <br>my wrist are displaced and my hand <br>quitedistorted in so much that I can<br>neither dress nor undress myself. So that <br>I fear I shallnot be able to venture <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2
</i>-
</center><br><br><br>to lie out of my own bed this winter. <br>what time of theAssembly I may <br>be at under mypresent circumstances <br>I cannot foretell; but whenever<br> Colonel   Jennings and I meet, if he<br>canconvince me that my enclosure <br>is upon any of his land, reasonwill <br>oblige me to make a properacknow<br>=ledgement to him.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I received the wrote against the <br>Lees and shall make use ofit as <br>occasion is given.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your other proposal about an <br>equal distribution of <notetarget="n4">Mr. Lee's

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never was one of those who were <br>for starving their causes;and you <br>are so strenuous&amp; diligent in suppor<br>=ting those you undertake, I shall<br>always be desirous of dependingupon <br>your abilities as often as I have oc<br>=casion.
</p><br>In all sincerity, sir, &amp;c<hr><center><h3>NOTES

</center><br><br><i>Source copy consulted: 
</i>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparentlythere was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- nowlost -- from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. Asthey are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. The copyistused a series of the letter "x" to indicate omission of material thathe did not copy.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The return address, county, and colony have beenadded for clarity to this unheaded letter.
