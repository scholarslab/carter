</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants Micajah and Richard Perry, July 14, 1720, concerning the affairs of the Lloyd estate (the lands belonging to John Lloyd, widower of Carter's niece, who had gone to England after his wife's death) that Carter aparently managed for the Perrys who held a lease from Lloyd. He reports bills of exchange drawn against the estate's accounts for Dr. Belfield's and Richard Meeks' (the overseer) salaries as well as one of his own for his use of four slaves on his lands, and some miscellaneous expenses. He comments that the estate's poor lands make it difficult to produce sufficient income, and that the estate's slave cooper is a "Bungler at the Trade" and the tobacco shipping casks are poor. He closes by asking the Perrys to remember the trouble he has had managing the estate's affairs if they should "find It necessary to give up Your  Interest in That Affair."
