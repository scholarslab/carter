</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, May 30, 1728, to report the arrival of goods and accounts, and to complain of certain of Stark's accounting methods. He informs Stark of several bills of exchange, and then seeks the merchant's support of the colony's effort to obtain repeal of the act prohibiting the importation of stemmed tobacco into Britain. In a lengthy post script dated July 9th, Carter encloses bill s of lading, complains of Stark's holding his tobacco too long before selling it, relates a misunderstanding over a "hamper" of claret, and orders some burgundy and champagne.

</a> is  Shipped   off.  It is become the Common trade  through  the Country <br>to buy up this under  Tobacco  as it is  called  but more properly Lugs <br>at half price and none is bad but the Planters can get Something <br>for it and when they lay out their Crops many will force the <br> Merchants  to take two or three under hogsheads or Else they will not let <br>them have their best These things your  Merchants  can give you <br>a better Account  of  than  I. Whereas if we are allowd to  Stem  <br>our under  Tobacco  we Should Seperate the good and heave the Trash <br>away and this  Stemmed   Tobacco  would be as  valuable  nay more <br> than  the best leaf which  we  know from long Experience.

</a><br><br><a name="n8"> [8] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
