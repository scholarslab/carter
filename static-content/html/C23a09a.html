</b> The will was admitted to probate February 1, 1670, as noted in the clerk's statement, but apparently was never copied into the court record book To have it copied into the court records, Robert Carter had it re-admitted to record January 9, 1723. The original is found in Lancaster County [Loose] Wills 1700-1749, and the recorded copy in Lancaster County Wills Etc. No. 10, Part 1, 1709-1727, pp. 416-420, both at the Library of Virginia, Richmond. 
</a><br>

<br><br>This editor was greatly facilitated in work on this will by Christine Jones's 1977 nearprint work,   <i>John Carter I of "Corotoman" Lancaster County, Virginia.
</i>  (Irvington, VA: Foundation for Historic Christ Church, 1977)
</a> prepared for the Research Committee of the Foundation.  The edition included a transcript of John Carter's will which this editor wass able to scan and use optical character recognition software to produce a text that he could read against the original text, saving the labor of re-transcribing the original text.
</a><br>

<br><br>The clerk writing out the original will added flourishes at the end of each line that filled the space between the last letter and the right margin of the page. The editor has not tried here to reproduce these flourishes.
</a> <br>

<br><br>The recording clerk in 1723 made some modest changes undoubtedly to speed his work; he frequently substituted "&amp;" for the word "and."
</a><br>

<br><br>Because the original will has been used as copy text, the signatures are original and are so indicated herein by the use of bold italics.
</a><br>

<br><br>For ease in reading the transcript, the editor has added a space between the elements of the will that begin "Item."

Henry Black, author of the standard law dictionary, defined dower as "the provision which the law makes for a widow out of the lands or tenements of her husband for her support." In a review of Susan Staves's  <i>Married Women's Separate Property in England 1660-1833,
</i>  Margaret A. Doody wrote: "In the older system that prevailed before the mid-seventeenth century, women had 'dower rights.' At common law, a widow was entitled to a life estate amounting to one-third of all the real property of which her husband had been the legal owner. Staves shows how such a provision came to be felt an unreasonable clog on an estate . . . The result was the invention of the 'jointure,' a settlement upon the wife if her husband predeceased her, as agreed upon in advance by prenuptial contract." (Jennifer Drobac.

There was appointed for each house an overseer . . . To the persons presenting hides he was required to sell plain shoes at the rate of thirty pounds [of tobacco] a pair. French falls of the largest size were to be sold to such persons at the rate of thirty-five pounds [of tobacco] a pair, whilst those of the smallest were to be sold at twenty pounds."  A knowledgeable staff member at Colonial Williamsburg has emailed the editor, "The main puzzlement is, that French Falls were made for men, women, and children, and for well over 100 years.  No one can fathom any known style or type of footwear that fits that description with certainty, at that price range, that's not slippers.
