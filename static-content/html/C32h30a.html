</sup> <br><br>30th August 1732<br><br>Mr. William Dawk.ins<br> <br>Sir,<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find by Several of Our Father's letters <sup><font color="green">a year or two ago
</i>
</font>
</sup> that He inten <br>ded to make use of yYour Assi [s] tance  in payng part of the Purchase <br>Money for <a href="Cbiodir.html#LL">Mr. Lloyd's Estate,
</a> that his cash in Mr. <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Alderman Per-<br>ry's
</a> Hands might not be too much drained. How He might alter his <br>Design afterwards, We can't say, but We find the Purchase was com <br> pleated  without any  Draughts  on You. By this Means great dis <br>putes have arisen <u>between Our Father and the Alderman
</u> upon <br>Account of the Discounts not being allowed <u>on his  Tobaccos 
</u>, and <u>He
</u> <sup><font color="green">the Alderman
</i>
</font>
</sup> <br>has before now seen how unkindly it was  <S><font color="red">its
</font>
</S>  taken  <S><font color="red">that
</font>
</S>  by our Father <br>that He could not have the usual Advantages after <sup><font color="green">so large a sum of 
</i>
</font>
</sup>his Money <br>had  layn  idle three or four Years, subject indeed to a payment in <br>the Court in Chancery, but without any Benefit in the mean time. <br>In Some of His Letters He tells the Alderman, He hoped to make him <br>such Remittances as would retreive his Credit in his Books and in <br>some measure make up the Prodigious Breach, which this large <br>Purchase had made. How this could have been effected, We cannot <br>at present  <S><font color="red">tell
</font>
</S>  pretend to guess, unless by <a href="C32h30a.html#n1">Bills
</a> drawn on You or <br>Mr. <a href="Cbiodir.html#JP">John Pemberton
</a> of  Liverpool . But we find such a large <br>Quantity of Tobacco <sup><font color="green">now
</i>
</font>
</sup> sent to this Gentleman, a very great part of <br>which is Stemmed and consequently for home Consumption, that <br>We can't imagine He could design to draw anything considerable <br>on  <S><font color="red">this Gent
</font>
</S>  him, when there would not sufficient remain to clear <br>the <a href="C32h30a.html#n2">Duties.
</a> The Conclusion must then be that He intended to have or-<br>der'd some of the Money in Your Possession to be paid to the Alderman <br>who will not otherwise have Money of Our Father's Estate to clear all <br>the Duties of  Tobacco's  consigned to him this present Year <sup><font color="green">for we do not think proper to touch the Bank Stock
</i>
</font>
</sup> not to <br>mention any thing of a large Sum He is to pay to <a href="Cbiodir.html#TF">Lord Fairfax.

</a><br><br><a name="n1"> [1] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
