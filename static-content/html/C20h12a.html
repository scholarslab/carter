</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to the lieutenant governor, AlexanderSpotswood, August 12, 1720, responding to his appointment as militiacommander for Lancaster and Northumberland counties, pointing out toSpotswood that many of those who are selected as subalterns will notaccept the commissions unless they know who their captains are to be,and further, because a number of them either cannot write or do so"very Indifferently," obtaining the lists of their men will be slowat best. He concludes that "I Shall do my best to follow Yor. honrs.Instrucs. according to there plainest meaning, &amp; Study to approvemy Self."
