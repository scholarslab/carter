<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  received  your Letter of the 13.  Instant  by my Sloop. It must be owned <br>
the  Convenience  of the Widow Cale's Land to yours was a temptation to you to <br>
buy it. From what the Widow said to me, &amp; from what others told me I had <br>
Intentions to send Orders to <a href="Cbiodir.html#RJ">Mr Jones
</a> &amp; <a href="C29k28a.mod.html#n1">Threalkill
</a> that no more Clearing <br>
should be made on that side next the Widow,  until  I could be satisfied where <br>
<a href="Cbiodir.html#NB">Mr Burwells
</a> proper Line should run. This order I now send to Mr <br>
Jones that the Overseer may conform to it.  Your  Offer seems to be reasonable. You <br>
propose to let me see your papers &amp; your Title. You tell me you claim under <br>
Motts patent; but that I take to be your Mistake. Burwell's Claim is <br>
under Mott's patent, &amp; yours I believe is under Catlet's which must be owned <br>
to be the Elder, if the Widow's Title comes regularly to her. You were Over:<br>
seer of my Affairs when <a href="C29k28a.mod.html#n2">Savage
</a> made his Survey, &amp; I am apt to think were <br>
at it. My directions to Savage were, tht. the Owners of the neighbouring Lands <br>
might have Notice, that he would lay it out in a  public  Manner, &amp; <br>
I have heard several times that Cale was at it &amp; did not oppose his running <br>
that Line. I believe all this you know. I must defend my <a href="C29k28a.mod.html#n3">Grandson's
</a> <br>
Lands as well as I can; but where things are plain against me, I should <br>
rather  choose  to compose  things
</i> in an amicable way;  the Law, as  you  say, ought to be the Last Resort &amp; is so to all peaceable  minds
</i>
</i>  And if it appears we have <br>
cleared into the Widow's Bounds that she  has  a just Claim to I shall be willing <br>
to purchase the Ground that we have cleared, or rather to the Bounds Savage gave <br>
us. This I think is as fair an Offer as I can make, &amp; I  beleive  you will think so <br>
too. The Ground already cleared I reckon is but a small piece, &amp; all taken in <br>
 <S><font color="red">within the Widow's Bounds
</font>
</S>   not very large. I write to Mr Jones to this purpose <br>
&amp; am 

</p>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your humble Servant.
