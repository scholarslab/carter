</a><br> <br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><note >RC usually wrote to Jonathan Mathews and John Goodwin jointly, and apparently meant this letter for them both as he used the plural salutation although the left margin of the letterbook is damaged and only Mathews' name can be read.
