</i> 
</a>
</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Corbin, August 20, 1706, that he has written before by an earlier fleet to send bills of lading for tobacco sent on consignment for the benefit of Ralph Wormeley's estate, and noting that he regrets that Wormeley's son Ralph is angry with the estate's trustees who have limited his expenses but that limits are necessary. He complains that Corbin has joined other merchants in opposing the Virginia practice of prizing tobacco, and suggests that Corbin and others must help planters find a way to make money that will do more than pay the duties. Virginia has received news of victories in the war, and the political conflicts in the colony are subsiding thanks to the work of the new governor, Edward Nott, but will continue if the former governor, Francis Nicholson, is allowed to continue to stir trouble in England. He closes by admonishing Corbin that he should not have joined his brother-in-law, Edmund Jenings, in a memorial against the colonial Council because the Council in the presence of the governor had repudiated it. Carter adds that he writes this only as a friend and that he will not be active in political affairs again.

He was one of the boys' trustees under their father's will.
