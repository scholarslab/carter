</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, July 5, 1723, to inform him that he has drawn a bill of exchange on him to the London slave traders, Francis Chamberlaye and Francis Sitwell. He reports several other bills, including one from John Wormeley for a cask of Tucker's brandy. He closes by noting that he hopes to send 10-12 hogsheads of tobacco on board Captain Wilson's ship but has not heard whether there will be room for  them on board. In a lengthy post script dated July 29th, Carter notes that Captain Wilson has been delayed by sickness, and that the weather has reduced the expectations of a good crop. He tells Tucker that the news of a prohibition of importation of stemmed tobacco into England has been confirmed in Virginia, and suggests that Tucker and the other English merchants will need to learn to "Cheat as fast as they [the Scots]," they may be able to survive. He is not sure how long this sad state of affairs will last because most Scots ships have not found cargoes other than tar this year because they arrived so  late.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Francis Chamberlayne  (abt. 1667-1728) was from a  Warwickshire family. His father was also a London merchant, and "Chamberlayne engaged in commerce himself and may have been involved in the slave trade." He was quite wealthy, and represented New Shoreham in Parliament at two different times, first as a Whig, and later as a Tory. ( David Hayton, <i>et al.,

</a><br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

When his older brother, Ralph died in 1714, John inherited all of their father's considerable estate in Middlesex and York counties.  He married Elizabeth Tayloe and had six children.

</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] The trading policies of Scots merchants were of considerable concern to Virginia planters and English  merchants at this time, and the matter came before Parliament in 1723. Vessels sent by Scots were crewed by captains and factors authorized to pay good prices in Virginia which enabled them to  obtain full cargoes. English merchants argued that the only way the Scots could afford to pay such good prices was their ability to avoid paying duties on the tobacco at home. Micajah Perry appeared before Parliament and gave statistics of the duties paid by his firm in earlier years and the far smaller amounts paid in the past several years because his ships could not obtain full cargoes in Virginia.
