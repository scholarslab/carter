<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, July 22,
1720, about "Jones's appeal" which it appears he will win; Carter is
pleased and notes "I Shall be very ready to Do That Gentleman any service
That may lye in my way." The remainder of the letter deals with
tobacco shipment and sales, and several bills of exchange. In a
postscript in his hand dated July 27, 1720, Carter reports some bills
of exchange, a bill of lading for tobacco shipped aboard the <hi
rend="italics">Mercury,
</i>
</b> and reminds Dawkins of his involvement
in the sale of a cargo of slaves, adding that he "had thots of Giving
You some Trouble in that affair, but have now thrown It wholly on Mr.
Perry."

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.
</a><br>

<br><br>The July 27, 1720, postscript is entirely in RC's hand as is
indicated by italics. 
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] This sentence was added as a note at the bottom of
the page of the draft to be inserted where it now appears.

Norfolk County, with whom RC was partners in the sale of the cargo of
slaves.
