</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, June 3, 1727, advising him of a bill of exchange payable to George Braxton that he has used to buy slaves because of the many he lost during the winter. He notes that he has received Stark's letter of February 20th, and hopes his shipment was not damaged in the grounding of the <i>Ann and Elizabeth,
</i> and adds that there was on board a small shipment from the Burwell estate. He will ship 30 hogsheads on the <i>Lucia.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

</a><br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
