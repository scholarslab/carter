</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, March 6, 1724, reporting that he is shipping 30 hogsheads of tobacco on board the <i>Burwell
</i> and that he assumes that the merchant will accept a freight rate of &pound;8 per ton. He understands that the <i>Carter
</i> and also Captain Richardson are on their way to the colony, but fears they will find it impossible to get good cargoes. In closing, he notes that Captain Adam Graves will not be able to fully load before he must sail.
