</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant, William Dawkins, May 27, 1721, reporting that freight rates on ships in the York River have been lowered to &pound;8 and those in the James River to &pound;7. The <i>Carter
</i> must look for freight at &pound;8 if she is to be loaded, but she is doing well thanks to his assistance. He wishes her captain, Bailey Kent, were more aggressive in seeking cargo. He complains about the pirates and the Crown's apparent lack of interest in protecting the colonial trade.

I have loaded 30 hogsheads on board Chandler and have <br>bin passive as to my  freit , wish I do not Suffer for my  lasieness  <br>we Shall Struggle hard to fill the Carter I wish  Baily  Kent had <br>a little more Mercury in the head of him and could undergo  fatiegue  <br>with a greater briskness,
