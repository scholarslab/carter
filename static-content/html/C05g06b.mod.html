</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Francis Lee, July 6, 1705, that he has received a letter from Lee in which Lee had written that the late Ralph Wormeley's sons, then in England at school, want to return to Virginia. Their mother favors their return, Carter reports, but add that he wants to be sure that all of the trustees of Wormeley's sons agree to this step that will so profoundly affect their futures. He states that Lee should send them home if all agree, and that it probably will be best for them because the estates that will come to them will allow only a living in Virginia business which will not satisfy them if they remain in England until they are men. Lee should equip them properly, but not too richly, for their station in Virginia when sending them.

</a> <br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
