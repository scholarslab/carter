</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his son, John Carter, May 27, 1721, then in London, to chastise him for his failure to write to his relatives in Virginia, and refusing to allow him to extend his stay in England because "my purse wont bear It." He will respond to other parts of John's letter later.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony  have been added for clarity.
