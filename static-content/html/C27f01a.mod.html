</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Robert Cary, June 1, 1727, concerning the failure of merchant Thomas Evans with whom he has had "very friendly Correspondance for more then 20 Years." Because, as he adds, "charity begins at home," he sends Cary an account of his debt due from Evans, and asks Cary to attempt to collect it, noting that he will send a power of attorney by a London ship as soon as he can. He regrets the damage to his tobacco shipped by the <i>Mansel
</i> but hopes Cary will find an "Advantageous Sale" for it.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft. Carter has added the complimentary close to the clerk's draft as is indicated by the italics.
