</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant James Bradley, May 17, 1727, reporting the arrival of Bradley's ship, the <i>Welcome,
</i> and of letters he has received from the merchant. He was disappointed with the sales of his tobacco, but notes that they were about what he had received from others. He is sending tobacco on board the <i>Providence
</i> and he sends a bill of exchange for the duties. He reminds Bradley that he wishes to find a place for his son Landon as an apprentice to   learn the Virginia trade, and hopes that Bradley will change his mind about taking Landon.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in this letter Bradley owned the <i>Welcome,
</i> but little information about Bradley has been located. (There is a listing of the firm of Bradly &amp; Griffin, Merchants, Fenchurch-street, opposite the Mitre Tavern, on page 13 of   <i><xref to="freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~frpayments/KD1740/AB.htm">Kent's Directory 
</a>For the Year 1740 Containing An Alphabetical List of the Names and Places of Abode of the Directors of Companies, Persons in Publick Business, Merchants, and other Eminent Traders in the Cities of London and Westminster, and the Borough of Southwark.

</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] The 140 ton <i>Welcome
</i> was owned by London merchant James Bradley as Carter notes here. John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1727. ( Adm 68/195, 154r, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Thomas Woodward commanded the <i>Providence
</i> during a number of voyages to the colony, 1723-1727. ( Adm. 68/194 and 195, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Sweetscented was one of two types of tobacco grown in Carter's day.  The other, oronocco, was "bulkier and coarser than sweetscented . . .  had a sharper leaf  'like a fox's ear,'" and was stronger in flavor" than sweetscented." ( Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.
</i>  Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953.  p. 97
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5]  Carter refers to the duty, logically called the impost, imposed by Britain on imported tobacco, and to the cocket (for which a fee was charged), which was the document bearing a cocket or seal issued by the "King's Customs House" that the impost had been paid. (See the definitions of each word in    <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online.

</a><br><br><a name="n6"> [6] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

</a><br><br><a name="n7">[7] Landon Carter (1710-1778) was Carter's seventh child by his second wife, Elizabeth (Landon) Willis. Landon would live at "Sabine Hall," Richmond County, and marry three times, leaving many descendants, some of whom own "Sabine Hall" today. As an adult, he would keep a very interesting and useful diary. A reproduction of a portrait of him may be found on the website of the <a href="http://www.christchurch1735.org/history/robert_carter.html.xml" target="_wblank">Foundation of Historic Christ Church.

</a><br><br><a name="n8">[8] Thomas Lee (1690-1750) of Westmoreland County was the son of Richard Lee II, and nephew of Edmund Jenings; he would build "Stratford," and succeed Carter on the Council.
