</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Evans, June 2, 1721, that all the London ships in the colony have lowered their freight rates to &pound;8 but one which Carter does not believe will find a cargo. He notes the poor crop due to the worms that are wiping out their young tobacco plants.
