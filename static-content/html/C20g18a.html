</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to merchant James Arbuckle, probably locatedin Liverpool, July 18, 1720, concerning wine that he has receivedwhich he considers "tollerable considering twas the Lowest price" butcondemning the brandy which was terrible. He suggests to Arbucklethat his supplier switched brandy after Arbuckle tasted it. He addsthat he no longer drinks claret because he believes it contributes togout, and requests that Arbuckle send him good white wine, notingthat it does not keep well in the colony.
