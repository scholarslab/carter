<br>29 June 1731<br><br>
Capt. Geo. Turbervile<br>
 
<br>Sir,<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to yours of yesterday I begin with the <br>
<a href="Cbiodir.html#JC1">Secretary's
</a> Business. <a href="C31f29c.html#n1">Mr. Lord
</a> of the 9th <sup><font color="green">Instant
</i>
</font>
</sup> tells me he had recd. of the Secre [tar] <sup><font color="green">ys 
</i>
</font>
</sup><br>
Tobo in their Parish Six hhds which you had told him he must accot <br>
to you for. I have given Will Rowing, who is now in my Sloop  --  <br>
particular orders to take in this Tobo if he can get it, however it will <br>
not be amiss if you spur on Lord to be  carefull  in getting the Tobo on board <br>
the Sloop. Mr. Lord mistakes himself when he  sayes  he  hath  no List of the <br>
Secretary's <sup><font color="green">Fees,
</i>
</font>
</sup> I'm sure he or some of his Officers had the list from me. <br>
I sent away the List I had from the Secretary's Office soon after it came <br>
to my hands. It amounted to 3694 pounds of Tobo.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary between his Clerk &amp; the Sheriff meets with  --  <br>
very extraordinary usage, what his fees came to in 1729 you are no  --  <br>
Stranger to. Four hhds of his  Tobaco  tht were to be weighty &amp; to come<br>
from Minors, were not  rowled  when my Sloop called for them not <br>
 till  I went up a little before Christmass, &amp; they were very light at last <br>
how much of the Accot is paid I know not. If this Sloop misses of his Tobo <br>
I believe Mr Lord may expect a Call from the Secretary. This Rate of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management

Management will hardly find him Paper &amp; Pens &amp; Ink for his <br>
office; he is to be here is  [<i>sic
</i>]
</i>
</font>
</sup> eight or ten  dayes  he will then consider <br>
what is proper for him to do.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to my own Business. Your <a href="C31f29c.html#n2">Bill of Exche
</a> <br>
for eight pounds five shillings &amp; Eleven pence discharges the Balla <br>
of your Money Debt. Your  ballance  in Tobo. Is 3901. <a href="C31f29c.html#n3">Sallard
</a> <br>
accots to me for three thousand one hundred &amp; thirty eight, You <br>
 Ballance  the Rest by a long Bed Roll of Fees, many of them I  --  <br>
understand not You charge me with Orders for Fines I don't re= <br>
member I ever had two pence for all the Fines; some of them I am <br>
sure are not mine to pay. The Charge of Mrs. Newton's Power of <br>
Attorney for Reliquishment of her Dower  <S><font color="red">is none of mine
</font>
</S>  <sup><font color="green">lies not properly against me
</i>
</font>
</sup><br>
 <S><font color="red">to pay
</font>
</S> ; I never authorized such a thing nor will I take any  --  <br>
thing less than her Personal appearance at Court &amp; Private  --  <br>
Examination as you already know; fees for this I suppose I <br>
shall hear of hereafter; I pray you therefore to put the Saddle<br>
upon the Right Horse.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mention something of a pair of Milstones I had  -- <br>
from <a href="C31f29c.html#n5">your Father
</a>. I remember I had a pair of stones from <a href="C31f29c.html#n4">Turkey <br>
Cock hill
</a> which was many Years before your Father died &amp; several<br>
years <sup><font color="green">after
</i>
</font>
</sup> I delivered them with his Consent, as far as I can collect<br>
the story, to Cap. <a href="C31f29c.html#n6">Richard Ball,
</a> who claimed them as his. I  --  <br>
know Nothing more of them, If I had them you should be  -- <br>
welcome to them; which is the  Needfull  at present from

<br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
