</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, June 2, 1727, noting that captains Hopkins and Woodward sailed without waiting for the convoy, and that they had carried letters telling Perry that Carter would not deal with him further unless he rectified Carter's complaints. Perry had written Carter in March that they should once again pursue the purchase of John Lloyd's Virginia estates (which Carter is managing), and Carter agrees but states that the value has fallen because of the great loss of slaves. Perry should first be aware that Carter is calling on his accounts with him for nearly &pound;500 to pay for slaves he has purchased, but Perry may offer &pound;3000 for the estate with the former conditions. If Perry is to pay the last year's rent for the Northern Neck proprietary, he should deduct Edmund Jenings's debt, and see that it is paid to Carter to whom it is due. Carter informs Perry that merchant Robert Cary will attempt to recover failed merchant Thomas Evans's debts to Carter.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
</a><br><br>Carter has added a few words to the text himself which is indicated by the use of italics.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Captain James Hopkins commanded the <i>Mary
</i> in 1727-1728. He was then working for London merchant Robert Cary. He is mentioned in Carter's diary. ( Adm. 68/194, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Thomas Woodward commanded the <i>Providence,
</i> a ship owned by Captain John Hyde &amp; Company, during a number of voyages to the colony, 1723-1727. ( Adm. 68/194 and 195, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia,
</a> and Carter's letter to the firm, 1723 September 17.)
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] A moiety is "a half, one of two equal parts."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online

</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Carter had noted in his diary July 29, 1727,  the arrival of the <i>Mansell,
</i> Captain Trevisa.
</a><br><br><a name="n5"> [5] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
