<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

<br><br><a name="n1"> [1] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See  <a href="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm"target="_wblank">"Bill of Exchange"

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Merchant James Buchanan (d. 1742) had run his business from Biddeford and Topsham, Devonshire, but he later moved it to London.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Robert Carter's home, "Corotoman," was located on the northeastern bank of the Rapphannock River in Lancaster County close to the present-day community of Weems.  A stream called Corrotoman [<i>sic
</i>] River ran inland west of the house. Carter built a fine house there in the mid 1720s, but it burned in January 1729. See the <a href="http://www.christchurch1735.org/history/corotoman.html"target="_wblank">"Corotoman" page
</a> of the web site of Historic Christ Church Foundation for more information about the house and excavation of its ruins.  ( See the <i>Maryland Gazette
</i> for February 4-11, 1728/29 for comment on Carter's loss. The Maryland Archives has placed its copies of the  <i>Maryland Gazette
</i> online. Unfortunately, page four of the issue of February 4-11, 1728/29 is missing, and that must be where the notice of the fire at Corotoman appeared; the text is quoted in secondary sources as reading: "The fine large house of Colonel Carter on the Rappahannock was also burnt lately. The particulars of his loss we can't give you, but we are inform'd it is very great." [<i>Garden Club of Virginia Journal
</i>, May-June 1983, p.8.])

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] This firm had been established in Madeira by Joseph Hayward in 1715. It became Hayward &amp; Rider (1721-1723),  Hayward Miles &amp; Rider (1725-1730), and other partnerships later.

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] A pipe is "a large container of definite capacity for storing solids or liquids, such as meat, fish, or oil. Now: spec. a large cask for storing wine or cider." Wikipedia, citing a book by Ronald E. Zupco, states that a pipe was half a tun which was "a large vat or vessel, most often holding 252 wine gallons," meaning a pipe was roughly 126 gallons of wine.

<br><br><a name="n7">[7]  "Edward Randolph (October 1690-<i>post
</i> 1756), sometimes referred to as Edward Randolph of Bremo, was a ship captain, a London tobacco merchant, and the seventh and youngest son of William Randolph and Mary Isham."  He was cited in York County records in 1740: "Edward Randolph of London, mercht, now residing in Virginia, devisee under the will of Graves Pack. . . ."  He was bankrupt by 1732 and Benjamin Harrison IV was among those who sued him. ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Randolph"target="_wblank">"Edward Randolph
