</b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. The first page or pages of this letter are missing; this letter concludes on the letter book page on which the succeeding letter (to Mann Page, August 27, 1729) was begun, and has accordingly been assigned that date. The leaves on which the draft was written have suffered some damage with portions missing along the margins affecting the text as well as smaller damage elsewhere.
</a>

<br><br>The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
</a>

<br><br>The last paragraph of the addition to this letter is in the hand of a different clerk.

</a>. Here Carter seated the Lodge Quarter mentioned in his will."  Timothy Dargan was its overseer in 1733 according to the <xref to=" http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C33inven.html">inventory of Carter's estate

<br><br><a name="n3">[3]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Horsepen Run joins Broad Run on the northern border of Dulles airport. The company was not successful.

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] It is not clear to what property Carter refers because there is no tract with this name in his will. There is a Sandy Run in today's Prince William County.  It runs from the north in Fountainhead Regional Park, and drains into the Occoquan Reservoir.  ( Alexandria Drafting Company.  <i>Regional Northern Virginia.

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] The Occaquan River is a major tributary of  the Potomac River that lay in Stafford County in Carter's day. Much of the river today is known as the Bull Run, and forms the boundary between Fairfax and Prince William counties, and to the west, between Loudoun and Prince William  counties.
