</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, September 17, 1723, complaining mildly of the poor tobacco sales the merchant has reported. He requests Stark find him a good barber surgeon either in Glasgow or Edinburgh, and adds later in the letter that he also needs a coachman, a carpenter, a blacksmith, a tailor, a brickmaker, and a bricklayer. He lets Stark know that a ship captain from another firm has solicited his business but that he will stay with Stark until he believes he is "Ill used."
