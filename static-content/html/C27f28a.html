</i> and to send three bills of exchange. In a post script dated July 26th, he sends some second bills of exchange, and a bill of lading (not present) for 20 hogsheads of tobacco in the <i>Carter.
</i> Good sales will encourage him to send more tobacco to Bradley each year. In a second post script dated August 22nd, he sends a bill of lading (not present) for 10 hogsheads on board the <i>Carter,
</i> and a bill of exchange (not present) .

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

</a> <br><br><a name="n3"> [3] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
