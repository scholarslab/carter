Mr. Edward Athawes<br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of us in the behalf of the <a href="C31g22a.html#n1">Frying Pan <br>
Company
</a>  hath  already given you the entertainment of seve --  <br>
ral letters which we have had the perusal of and are <br>
 [agr] eeable to our sentiments In a clause of a letter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#WD">Mr Daw -- <br>
 [kins] 
</a> of the sixth Instant we acquainted you of the poor pros -- <br>

Bunton and another of a Saturday night Got drunk fell aboard <br>
several of our servants and our Ovcrseer as he told us hardly Escaped <br>
with whole bones cursing and daming us and all our concerns <br>
and on the day following left their business pretending they would <br>
come to their Masters to complain of the usage they met with the chief <br>
fault they found was against their provision although the rest of <br>
their fellows own to us they have not want'd <sup><font color="green">plenty of very good
</i>
</font>
</sup> salt meat one day from <br>
their being there &amp; that several venison <sup><font color="green">had been
</i>
</font>
</sup> kill'd for them and had <br>
plenty of sweet milk from the Cow morning and Evening They<br>
plead it as the custom of Miners that every <a href="C31g22a.html#n3">red letter day
</a> are  holydays  <br>
to them and that Saturdays in the afternoon are their own and that <br>
this custom they will not give up upon this pretence they have <br>
made so many  holydays  which we never heard of before that the work <br>
they have done  hath  been very little a great deal less than we did <br>
with fewer unskill'd people before they came to us in the contracts <br>

keeping  holydays  indeed they are  stil'd  <a href="C31g22a.html#n5">Tinners

 'T'is  to be own'd they came away with a very good character from <br>
<a href="C31g22a.html#n6">Mr James

influence of this custom if there be such a one we shall not <br>
Say but  tis  very plain Howeis and Brunton are our servants <br>
by common <a href="C31g22a.html#n7">Indentures
</a> they are  stil'd  only as diggers in Mines <br>
they were taken up as <a href="C31g22a.html#n8">Strollers

want of bread and common  Necessarys  were the Great persuasives <br>
to them to come aboard Haweis whom you express so good <sup><font color="green">an

on of and indeed who deceiv'd us as much  till  we came to try <br>
him proves the greatest rogue in the Pack and as our Overseer informs <br>
us makes the rest a great deal more  [. . . ]  than they would be <br>
and he think would be of advantage for us to discharge him <br>
from our business and some of the Bristol Miners affirm <br>
that to their knowledge this Howeis  hath  been several years  [aboard]  <br>

behaviour of these fellows for it seems in their cups they have <br>
not only curs'd us but threatn'd to write both to you and Mr James <br>
and to  sew  Mr James's bond We write nothing here but what we <br>
have in a letter from Nicholas himself

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may depend upon it as for the three Fal --  <br>

not want a  plentifull  maintenance both of provision and <br>
other  necessarys  to content them if anything that is reason --  <br>
able will do it but for Haweis and Brunton as they are our <br>
Servants upon another foot we dare say you will not blame <br>
us if we take proper measure to bring them to better Manners

Ore that the Vein was about a foot broad and six foot high and we <br>
have since had a random story but brought with a great deal <br>

larger than less thus our drooping hopes stand reviv'd at pre --  <br>

We would Earnestly desire you<br>
to give us a full Accot of what the<br>
customs of these miners are in relation<br>
to  Hollidays  &amp; saturdays in the Afternoon and<br>
in what manner their general ways of Working <br>
are whether by the day the month the Year or <a href="C31g22a.html#n10">by <br>
the  grate 
</a> <sup><font color="green">or are paid according to the quantity of ore they raise

under their Present Contracts have a right to insist <br>
upon these customs<br>

There is water damage to some leaves of the letter book making reading the text difficult.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Vizt. is the abbreviation for the Latin word "videlicet";  it means "that is to say; namely; to wit: used to introduce an amplification, or more precise or explicit explanation, of a previous statement or word." (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary
</i>  online.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter refers to the ancient custom of  "(a) (originally) a saint's day or other Christian festival conventionally indicated in the calendar by red letters;  (b). . .  any significant, memorable, or happy day. . . ."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Carter refers to miners recruited from Falmouth, Cornwall, England. There have been tin mines in Cornwall abd Devon since prehistoric times.  (Wikipedia's entries on this subject appear reliable.)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] According to the  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i>  a tinner is "one who gets or digs tin ore; a tin-miner."  
</a>

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] Mr. James has not been identified.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n7">[7] An indenture is a contract between two or more parties. It is so named because copies of such a contract in early times were often written at the top and the bottom of a sheet which was then cut apart in a jagged or indented manner. The copies could then be fitted together to prove autheiticity.   "The contract by which an apprentice is bound to the master . . . by which a person binds himself to service in the colonies, etc."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n8">[8] A stroller is "a vagabond, vagrant; an itinerant beggar or pedlar."   (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n9">[9] Carter probably means by "at the Hoe" that he served his indenture as an agricultural worker.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n10">[10] In this context, "by the great" means "as a whole, all together," meaning by the entire job.  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
