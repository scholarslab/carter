</b> Robert Carter will, 1732 October 16, Carter
Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. The text is
contained in a bound volume and is a copy of a copy of the original
probated in the General Court whose records were destroyed in the
Richmond fire at the end of the Civil War. This copy was prepared and
is attested to by Wilson Allen, Clerk of the General Court. Its
source was a copy of the original made and attested to by Matthew
Kemp, appointed clerk of the General Court about 1731. Given the
number of duplicated words and other errors in this text, one must be
sympathetic to the boredom of Allen in transcribing this long and
tedious text. 
</a>

<br><br>The will was published first in the   <i>Virginia
Magazine of History and Biography,

</a> This publication is based on a second 
manuscript copy of the will known as the St. Leger Landon Carter copy.  Aside from the will and its codicils, the book
 contains some other material such as "epitaphs of John Carter and Robert Carter" which St. Leger Landon Carter
 had copied from the stones at Christ Church.

<br><br>In the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Museum and Memorial Library, Fredericksburg, Virginia, 
there is a nineteenth-century copy of Carter's will made by the person who planned a biography of Carter, and who
 copied texts of Carter letters from a letter book, now lost. 1n 1963, the Minor-Blackford Papers were loaned to the 
Library of Virginia, and photostatic copies made, including Carter's will. Many of the Minor-Blackford Papers were 
microfilmed by the University of Virginia Library at this same period.

are notes on some of his letters, "Harvey to copy." A John Harvey
witnessed his will, and some of its codicils, which is logical if
Harvey had written it out for Carter. However, on 1729 November 14,
Carter wrote to Micajah Perry that Harvey, "whom you sent me from the
Hospital," had completed his service, indicated that he did not trust
Harvey, and intimated that Harvey may have stolen some accounts of
the Burwell estate of which he requested copies from Perry.
