<br>Sir<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received your  severall <br>
letters and congratulate you on your<br>

</a> place. <a href="Cbiodir.html#EA">Mr  Athaws 
</a><br>
and I have given security for you<br>
here at our [omission in text]

will take care that there shall never<br>
be any mistake or error.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also desire you will be very <br>
punctual and exact in doing all<br>
your business as a Merchant to be<br>
sure to endorse all <a href="C29l24a.html#n2">your bills
</a><br>
regular and to  give advice to what<br>
Account they are to be placed; for<br>
I shall keep your Naval Office<br>
Account distinct; and to advise<br>
whenever you draw any bills:<br>
for I will pay no bills without<br>
advice altho' I believe it may be

your hand. Also, draw your bills <br>
at sixty days, which gives time to <br>
be in cash if it should be otherwise. <br>
I desire you will write to me often. <br>
Your place gives you great opportu=<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Tobacco Trade, it continues<br>
 bad -- the price low. Notwithstand<br>

far from with us at present.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to your <a href="C29l24a.html#n3">Copper mine
</a>, it is <br>
likely to be a very good thing; but <br>
Mr  Athaws,  who has taken a great <br>
deal of pains in having it proved by <br>
the greatest artist, will give you a <br>
full account of what [omission in text]

of it.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	As I have had some small share in your <br>
education, so I can't forbear giving you advice <br>
and recommending to you strict virtue and <br>
integrity in every action of your life.

any rarity of trees of plants, it <br>
will be an acceptable present; <br>
which is all I shall trouble you <br>
with at present, but assure you <br>
I am

<br><br>Robert Carter had written to Dawkins on  <a href="C29h26c.html"target="_wblank">August 26, 1729
</a>, to request his support in Charles's becoming naval officer.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The naval officer was an official in the colony that reported to the Commissioners of Customs, a body that had first been established in 1663; the group was reorganized several times, especially after 1688. The board was "intrusted with collection of customs both in England and the colonies." The board helped write many of the instructions for colonial governors in collaboration with the Privy Council. "Their direct connection with the colonies was through the governors, who were instructed to correspond with the commissioners, and to send them, every three months, lists of clearances, and also reports of illegal trading. The governor's agent in matters of trade was the naval officer whom he was empowered to appoint, but who was required by the 7th and 8th William III to give security to the commissioners of customs."

<br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See  <a href="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm"target="_wblank">"Bill of Exchange"
</a> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company they named Frying Pan to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.

</a> and his son, <a href="Cbiodir.html#AB2">Arthur Bailey
</a>, as Alan Simpson has speculated. (<a href="Cbibl.html#A3">Simpson. "Robert Carter's Schooldays." p. 173, fn. 29.)
