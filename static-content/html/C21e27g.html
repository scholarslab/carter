</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant, Edward Tucker, May 27, 1721, to report that he has received letters Tucker sent with captains Russel and Wilson. The latter had a stormy passage and had to throw overboard 300-400 "foot of my stones." He complains about the poor prices Tucker has sold his tobacco for and notes that William Dawkins in London found a better market. He is sending 30 hogsheads on board Russel, reports the large numbers of ships in the colony, many of which will not be able to find cargoes, and complains about the pirates and the lack of protection provided against them.
