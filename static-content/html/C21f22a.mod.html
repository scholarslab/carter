Peter Hedgeman -- <br>
 

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unexpected Death of Your  father was very Shocking<br>
to me. I heartily wish he had  met   with a more natural fate, he  has   been <br>
a very great delinquent of late from my business much contrary to the <br>
Articles he was under to me, had he been in the Discharge of his Duty &amp; at the <br>
place he ought to have made his home he might have been a living <br>
man at this day, I Shall be willing to do him Justice for the time he <br>
was in my Service, You have done very well to go to the  Several quarters   &amp; to take <br>
a written Account  of my Stocks and Goods there, I have  employed   one

</center><br><br>
John Johnson  [who]    has   been my Overseer for some years to succeed Your <br>
Father as my  General   Overseer to him I would have You give up the  accounts   <br>
You have taken &amp; I would also have You not remove Your  Fathers <br>
bed but  let   him have the use of It,  until   he can  get   up one of his <br>
own which will be by the next Sloop that comes, I hope You have <br>
 followed   my orders, in Marking &amp; weighing my Tobacco  &amp;c, and that the Sloop <br>
is  dispatched   away before now, besides the Goods  that  went in the last Sloop <br>
 Your  Father had a great many other Goods of mine under his Care <br>
which I Expect You will take care to See  delivered   to the  aforesaid   John<br>
=son, The greater Your  diligence is in what relates to me, to more Induce  me
</i> <br>
I shall have to be  easy   in repect to Your Fathers negligences that he <br>
 has   been guilty of in my business altogether contrary to the Conditions <br>
that were between us,
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Your  proposal of Succeeding Your Father in my busi<br>=ness It appears to be a very odd Thought in You, You must have some more <br>
Years over Your  head &amp; a greater Share of Experience in the world as well <br>
as to  let   It be Seen what  courses   You will fall upon in the  management   <br>
of  yourself  &amp; Your  own business, before any Judicious person will think <br>
You capable of Such a Charge as mine is, what kindness will  lie   in my <br>
way in respect to the long  employment   Your  father had under me <br>
I shall be ready to do you who am 
</p>

<br>Your  Friend

He became a lawyer, and "long represented Stafford in the Assembly, and was one of the Crown Commissioners for the location of the Northern Neck boundary in 1746."
