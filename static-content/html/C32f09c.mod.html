</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, June 9, 1732, to report the arrival of a ship,  the <i>George &amp; Mary,
</i> Tucker has chartered, and the arrangements that he and George Eskridge have made concerning her. He adds comments about the small tobacco crop that will prevent many ships obtaining large cargoes, but hopes this will send the market up.
