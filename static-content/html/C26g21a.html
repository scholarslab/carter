</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to William Cage,  trustee of the Fairfax estate, July 21, 1726, to  chide him for not writing at least annually which Carter hopes he willl do in the future. He believes that the Northern Neck case has been carried to England by the colony's attorney general. He notes that his receipts of quit rents from the Northern Neck propietary come in very slowly, and he hopes that Cage will not press for the lease rent each year. And he hopes that Cage will allow him credit for money that Edmund Jenings overpaid to the proprietors, and which Jenings has withheld from payments due Carter.
