</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter advises London merchant John Goodwin, August 20, 1706, of a previous letter concerning the affairs of the estate of Ralph Wormeley, and that he has received an account of sales and an account current. He reports that the estate trustees have drawn bills of exchange on the estate's accounts for overseer Jeptha Edmunds' wages, and for William Churchill's construction of a mill.  He adds that a balance due the estate will be paid to Goodwin, and that he encloses an invoice for goods for the estate which has instructions both for the purchase and shipping.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter often referred to in their youth as his "Cozns." Ralph Wormeley (ca. 1681-1714), Ralph Wormeley's (d.1701) oldest son; and John Wormeley (1689-1727) because their parents were his brother-and sister-in-law. He was one of the boys' trustees under their father's will.
