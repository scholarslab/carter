</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant  Alderman [Micajah] Perry,May 12, 1732, to report the arrival of a number of letters and accounts by several ships concerning his own and the affairs of the Burwell and Page estates. He asks the merchant to consider a discount  on some transactions, and is pleased to  have the final deeds for the purchase of the Lloyd estate although there may problems obtaining acceptance in the colonial courts whose standards are different from those in England. The charges of the British lawyer who handled the Lloyd transaction are far greater than he had expected but must be paid. Comments about local matters including payment of debts such as those of Dr. George Nicholas and tobacco shipments follow. He thanks Perry for writing that his grandson, Lewis Burwell, has survived the small pox and for nice comments about Burwell, but adds that it would have been nice if Burwell had bothered to write to his mother and grandfather.

</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Carter held a lease to the Lloyd estate, which was that of John Lloyd, husband of his niece Elizabeth, for many years. He noted in a <a href="C23g13a.html"target="_wblank">letter to Micajah Perry
</a> July 13, 1723, that the estate consisted of about 1,900 acres. These holdings apparently lay up the Rappahannock near the falls as Carter always  sent his sloop for its tobacco.  The estate's tobacco mark was the double arrowhead or double "L" which Carter frequently uses in hisdiary and letters to refer to it. He undertook to buy the Lloyd estate in the later years of his life, and finally acquired it about 1732. (<i>Revised 2007 Nov. 30

</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] "The governor's Council, also known as the Council of State or simply the Council, consisted of about a dozen of colonial Virginia's wealthiest and most prominent men. Beginning in the 1630s the Crown appointed Council members. . . . Crown appointments were lifetime appointments. From 1625, when Virginia became a royal colony, until the outbreak of the American Revolution (1775-1783), the Council members advised the royal governor or his deputy, the lieutenant governor, on all executive matters. The Council and the governor together constituted the highest court in the colony, known initially as the Quarter Court and later as the General Court. The Council members also served as members of the General Assembly; from the first meeting of the assembly in 1619 until 1643 the governor, Council members, and burgesses all met in unicameral session. After 1643 the Council members met separately as the upper House of the General Assembly."

</a><br><br><a name="n7">[7] Quit rent was the term used for "a (usually small) rent paid by a freeholder . . .  in lieu of services which might otherwise be required; a nominal rent paid (esp. in former British colonial territories to the Crown) as an acknowledgement of tenure," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online

</a><br><br><a name="n10">[10] The <i>Micajah &amp; Philip
</i> was a large vessel of some 400 tons carrying a crew of 27. The captain's name varies from record to record as James Bradley or James Bradby. Thomas Jones wrote to his wife, then in England, concerning this ship in 1728, "The Micajah &amp; Philip that comes to James River is as good as the best Ships that Comes hither, but Bradby the master seems to be a little conceited and prodigal."

</a><br><br><a name="n12">[12] Carter uses the word "plunge" in the sense of "the point at which a person is precipitated into trouble, difficulty, or danger; a critical situation, a strait; a dilemma."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online

</a><br><br><a name="n13"> [13] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

</a><br><br><a name="n14">[14] John Falconar (1677-1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. He apparently was in  New Jersey and Maryland, 1699-1705. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See <a href="C27g24d.html"target="_wblank">Carter's letter to Falconar
