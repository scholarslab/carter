</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter often referred to in their youth as his "Cozns." Ralph Wormeley (ca. 1681-1714), Ralph Wormeley's (d.1701) oldest son; and John Wormeley (1689-1727) because their parents were his brother-and sister-in-law. He was one of the boys' trustees under their father's will.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Mr. Walker may have been the supercargo, or owner's representative, on the ship. 
</a> <br><br><a name="n3">[3] This ship probably is a 75-ton, English-built ship named the <i>Nynion &amp; Benjamin
</i> commanded by Nenyon Masters. (<a href="Cbibl.html#M10">Naval officer's return for Rappahannock River, 1705 June 24-Sept. 29, CO5/1441, ff. 458.
