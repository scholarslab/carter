</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, September27and October 10, 1720, to inform him of bills of exchange he hasendorsed and sent to Perry for &pound;281/16/11 being payment he hasreceived for slaves from the ship <i>Mercury
</i>,owned by Chamberlayne&amp; Sitwell. He believes the bills are good, but gives instructionsfor Perry's payment to the other merchants should any be protested.He reports the death of John Baylor, "The great Negro Seller &amp; inall respects the greatest Mercht. we had among us."  In a post script datedOctober 10th, Carter reported the depradations of a "Spanishprivateer," but the paper of the addition is so badly damaged that itis nearly illegible.

</a> The page on which the post script is written is one of the worst inthe letter book with a great deal of bleed through from the reverseand places where the ink has eaten entirely through thepaper.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity. Either Carter dictated that the letter was to be sent to the"Messrs. Perry," or his clerk wrote this from habit; Carter knew thatRichard Perry had died in April.
