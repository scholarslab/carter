Sr. <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours of the 7:th of  April   and 28:th of May <br>came Safe, giving me proofs beyond a pretence<br>of your kindness to Virginia in General, and of <br>your friendship to me in particular, though they<br>are not the first of both sorts that  have   resulted <br>from you, you have lived too long not to be<br>acquainted with the unruliness of the Voice of <br>the People. I have formerly told you I would<br>have had it otherwise, though am almost glad <br>your hand was not in it, Seeing We met with<br>no better Success; and believing there was such <br>a Current the other way that 'twas very nigh<br>impossible to stem the Tide with the Strong=<br>est arm; But as bad as it is can hardly think <br>itworse than We deserve, And believe you <br>will be of my Opinion when you come to <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Country is highly indebted to <br><a href="Cbiodir.html#MP">Mr Perry
</a> for his Warmness in our affairs, And <br>I believe hewill hardly miss of thanks from most <br>of those who have any business with him; <br>And if the Brainsof our Patriots are not quite <br>brutified, We Shall look for no other person to <br>Countenance ourAffaires, unless we were So wise <br>to joyn you with him. It is a Strange fate <br>that We are under,that everything that is said <br>against us Should be of such mighty weight, <br>and what We Say OurSelves, though ever So true &amp; <br>convincing, Should all be but Dross &amp; uncurrent <br>Mettle
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be kept from Our homes and Our Business, <br>to be hired out week after week, without almost<br>the pretense of anything to do, And the Burgesses <br>to go to play almost every day before ourgreat <br>Edifice, on purpose to be taken notice of; I say <br>that these things Should be hardships Weare <br>forced to endure here And yet that these things <br>elsewhere Shold be chargeable upon us as<br>Crimes; That four of the upper House Should <br>be forced to undergo all the business, No<br>more enduring to abide the Healot, the fatigues, <br>the Indignities, I say that these should be our<br>Crimes too, What may we expect will pass <br>for reason on our Side, or what have We <br>to do,but to lay our hands a cross and never <br>let our Tongues express our complaints any <br>more

</center><br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very much obliged to you for <br>your Zeal in the <a href="C03c01a.mod.html#n4"> Affair   of the Northern<br>Neck
</a>; not out of the mighty Love I have for <br>the Place, which carrys a great deal oftrouble <br>and uneasiness along with it, more I doubt <br>than the Profit will recompense, but for<br>your earnest and unwearied Solicitations <br>in my favour.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I take the thing right, Mr Perry is to <br>manage for the Proprietors, And accordingly <br>I haveentertained him with the Steps I have <br>taken.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Power I had was not only as short in <br>form but in Proof too, as I have noted both <br>to<a href="C03c01a.mod.html#n5">my Lord
</a> and Mr Perry, and have Sent <br>to the  latter Copies of the Power <a href="C03c01a.mod.html#n6">F[it]zHugh

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have <br>tired you enough for once, yet Shall tres=<br>pass upon you again very Suddenly, Will<br>therefore conclude at this time only with <br>taking leave to subscribe my Self what <br>in truth Iam

</i> CO 5/1313, ffs. 48 recto, 49 verso, Public Record Office, London. Microfilm copy in the collections of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert H. Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.This appears to be one of the several copies of the letter that Carter would have had prepared and sent by separate ships to ensure the safe delivery of at least one in England. The signature is not Carter's but of the clerk who wrote out the copy.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter apparently refers to the controversy between Commissary James Blair and other members of the Council with Governor Francis Nicholson. Shortly after this letter was written, Carter was to join fellow Council members Blair, Philip Ludwell (1672-1727, son of the addressee of this letter), John Lightfoot, Mathew Page, and Benjamin Harrison in a petition and memorial to Queen Anne asking for Nicholson's recall. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B17">Morton,  <i>Colonial Virginia

</a> The petition is in <a href="Cbibl.html#B18">Headlam.  <i>Calendar of State Papers Colonial Series.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter, then speaker of the House of Burgesses, had been elected treasurer of the colony by the House in 1699, and was continued in office until 1705 even though he had taken his seat on the Council on July 10, 1700. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B10">McIlwaine.  <i>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .

</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Gloucester County had elected Peter Beverley as one of its burgesses to the previous session. He succeeded Carter as speaker in 1700, and was re-elected at each session through 1705, and again in 1710-1714. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B1">Kukla.  <i>Speakers and Clerks. . . .
