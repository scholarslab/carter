</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Philip Ludwell of Green Springs, James City County, July 11, 1705, that he cannot attend either of two scheduled meetings. He informs Ludwell that Joshua Moore, captain of H.M.S. Oxford, plans to sail on the 20th, and that their letters may safely be sent by him. He assures Ludwell that "my Lord Orkney is Govr. of Virginia" because he has learned it from a letter brought in by a Scot named Chartres who arrived two days earlier, and who had told Carter that he saw the news in the press in London which he left in April; Carter sends Ludwell a copy (not present) of the letter. Chartres also has told Carter that Commissary Blair was coming to the colony in a naval vessel that would soon arrive. Carter counsels Ludwell to be patient because it appears that their problems (referring to their strife with Lt. Gov. Francis Nicholson) will soon be over.
