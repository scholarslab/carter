</a> Wright misdated the letter as April27, 1720, because the top half of the letter is extremely difficultto read. There is a great deal of bleed-through from the text on thereverse side of the letter book page as well as a hole in a portionof the page.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity.
