</i> 
</a>
</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to [Thomas Lee], July 5, 1721, concerning the affairs of the Northern Neck proprietary for which Lee had been acting agent in Virginia until 1715 while the agent, his uncle Edmund Jenings, was in England. He notes that Lee had granted land to his uncle in 1719, and informs Lee that he and Jenings had reached an agreement about the payment of quit rents that Jenings owed, and that they have also agreed to refer the question of "Downings Composition" to lawyers for settlement. He asks Lee to send him payment for certain lands that Lee has granted to himself after the expiration of his power of attorney from Lady Fairfax. Carter then turns to the matter of the Ashton lands owned by "Esq. Jeoffrys, the heir of Ashton in England." The remainder of the letter is missing.

</a><br><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Carter probably refers to Sir Jeffrey Jeffreys, MP, heir to the business affairs of his uncle, John Jeffreys (1614-1688), master of the Grocers Company and alderman in 1661.Carter had been interested in the Ashton lands for some time, and had written about them in a <a href="C21c25a.mod.html"target="_wblank">letter to William Dawkins
</a> on March 25, 1721. The lands probably were those on the Potomac River "known as Chatterton or Chatterton Landing and . . .  now located in King George Co." bequeathed by Colonel Peter Ashton to "James Ashton, his brother of Kirby Underwood County, Lincolnshire and to John Ashton his brother of Lowell, Lincolnshire. . . .
