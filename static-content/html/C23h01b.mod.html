</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to the London firm known as Captain John Hyde and Company, August 1, 1723, reporting the arrival of a letter the firm had sent by Captain Hopkins, complains mildly about the low prices his tobacco has brought, and more strongly about the firm's warehousing and "watching" charges. He has copies of the new act of Parliament concerning the importation of tobacco, and notes that it will mean good prices for the tobacco that is now heading for market even though there are long-term disadvantages for the colonial planters.

</a> The Lowness of the Sales <br>are very  surprising   however I shall feed myself with hopes <br>of better times, We can never bring Buckle and Thong together <br>At these  rates, The charge of Your Warehouse Room is beyond <br>anything that Ever I saw since I knew what a hogshead of Tobacco  was <br>two Shillings per hogshead is the Price I have been Acquainted with <br>All England over, Indeed One Gentleman this Year  charges   <br>me 6  pence   more for Tobacco  that went in 1720, You have  <S><font color="red">a Charge

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have Several  copies   of the <a href="C23h01b.mod.html#n3">New Tobacco  Law
</a>  prohibiting   <br>the Importation of  stemmed   Tobacco  which In Appearance seems to <br>Portend many Disadvantages to Us, but in reason one <br>Would think It would help all that sort of Tobacco  that is now <br>going home, The  smokers   knowing they are to have no more <br>of It will be fond of laying in large Stocks I remain
