</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

</i> was commanded by Captain Constantine Cant and may have been  owned by William Dawkins and Micajah Perry as Carter reported her December 1723 arrival to each of them.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter may refer to an excise tax which the colonists favored because of a variety of problems with the taxes on their tobacco, and particularly because of the act of parliament to which Carter refers earlier in his letter. Collecting debts owed by colonists to merchants in Great Britain was difficult for the merchants because of restrictive laws about proof of debts in Britain, and because there were two sets of books 3,000 miles apart, that carried the details of each transaction. In 1732 British merchants got through the act of parliament that made it much easier for them to collect these debts "merely on their own oaths" and which allowed them "to attach both real estate and slaves to secure them."

</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] The editor has been unable to determine what word Carter meant from what the clerk wrote down.
</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Carter's remark was prophetic for he had less than a month to live.
</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] Several vessels named <i>The Loyalty
</i> sailed to Virginia. One commanded by Francis Wallis cleared from Poole for Virginia in 1726. Captain Edward Loxam commanded  a vessel of this name in 1729-1732 as did James Tarleton in 1732.
