</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to the trustee of the Fairfax estate,William Cage, of County Kent, England, June 30, 1724, concerning the possibility of obtaining a new lease of the agency of the Northern Neck proprietary. He observes that he  makes no money at all from his lease because rents, when he can collect them, are paid in tobacco the value of which is  very low, and which rents are further devalued by cheating tax collectors and planters who falsely mark tobacco casks which they fill with "trash."

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br>There are two recipient's copies of this letter. The conjoined address leaf of the text above reads: "To | Wm. Cage Esqr | At Milgate | In the parish of Bearshed | In the County of | Kent | per The Prins. Carolina | Capt. Holladay." It is endorsed in Cage's handwriting, "June the 30th 1724 | Coll Carter."  The second is marked "Copy" at the foot and is dated July 9, 1724. Its address leaf reads "To be left with Mr. Micajh. Perry | LONDON Per the Spotswood | Capt. Bagwell." Both copies are signed by Carter (indicated by the use of bold italics) and sealed with his arms.
