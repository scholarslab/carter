<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter built a fine house  in the mid 1720s, but it burned in January 1729. See the <a href="http://www.christchurch1735.org/history/corotoman.html"target="_wblank">"Corotoman" page
</a> of the web site of Historic Christ Church Foundation for more information about the house and excavation of its ruins. (See the <i>Maryland Gazette
</i> for February 4-11, 1728/29 for comment on Carter's loss. The Maryland Archives has placed its copies of the  <i>Maryland Gazette
</i> online. Unfortunately, page four of the issue of February 4-11, 1728/29 is missing, and that must be where the notice of the fire at Corotoman appeared; the text is quoted in secondary sources as reading: "The fine large house of Colonel Carter on the Rappahannock was also burnt lately. The particulars of his loss we can't give you, but we are inform'd it is very great." [ <i>Garden Club of Virginia Journal
</i>, May-June 1983, p.8.
