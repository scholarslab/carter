</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, write to London merchant William Dawkins, July 5 and 26, 1723, reporting the safe arrival of goods ordered on behalf of the "children," probably the children of Carter's deceased son-in-law, Nathaniel Burwell (1680-1721). They complain that Dawkins has not given the children's account the benefit of the customs discounts. They send a bill of lading for 7 hogsheads of tobacco, and report a bill of exchange to Carter for expenses and enclose an invoice (not present) for goods for the children and their slaves. They request Dawkins make available &pound;10 to Isaac Lee when he reaches England, should he need it. In a post script dated July 26th, Carter reports four bills of exchange drawn on Dawkins.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
</a><br><br>This letter is written in the plural, and it probably was written by Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, on behalf of the children of Carter's deceased son-in-law, Nathaniel Burwell (1680-1721), fr whom the two had written previous letters.
