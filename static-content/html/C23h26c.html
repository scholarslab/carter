</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, August 26, 1723, directing him to purchase bank stock with Carter's annuity if he will not take the money himself at the interest Carter had proposed. Carter wants to move ahead on this because he plans to give the sum to his younger children. Carter mentions the sum due him in the arbitration settlement with Wise's executors, and that he has written Perry about the extremely poor crop. He also notes that he hopes his tobacco will bring better prices because the crop will be smaller and much had to be thrown away because of the new Act of Parliament banning the importation of stemmed tobacco into England. Finally, he reports a bill of exhchange (not present) that he sends, and that he also sends his account for the administration of John Lloyd's estate for 1722.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
