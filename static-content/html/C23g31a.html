</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, July 31, 1723, concerning Dawkins's offer to assist in the purchase Lloyd's Virginia estate [which Carter had managed for some years]. He understands that an arbritation of his "controversie" with Wise [in England] had resulted in payment into Micajah Perry's hands but he has not heard about it from Perry. Friends have seen letters recently arrived in Virginia that declare the bill including the prohibition of stemmed tobacco into England is a "Certainty" which "will have a very fatal Effect upon us." He turns to his instructions to Dawkins to return his son Robin to Virginia, noting that he had thought he might arrive in the current ship, but directs Dawkins to send Robin with Captain Benjamin Graves if he sails early.
