<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Parliament had passed an act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. John Randolph was sent to England in 1728 as agent for Virginia to try to have the act overturned; his mission was successful, and he was home in the colony by <a href="C29f02a.html"target="_wblank">June 2, 1729
</a>, when Carter wrote to welcome him home. ( Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] John Russell commanded the <i>Portland,
</i> a vessel owned by Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker as is noted in a letter from <a href="C27f28g.html"target="_wblank">Carter to Tucker,

<br><br><a name="n3"> [3] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<br><br><a name="n4">[4]  The <i>Bailey
</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove 1730-1732. She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members.

</a> A letter of Carter's to Dawkins <a href="C32e12b.html"target="_wblank">May 12, 1732,
</a> refers to "your ship Bailey." as does a letter of August 10, 1733, from Carter's executors to Dawkins. [ Lloyd T. Smith, Jr., <i>ed.
