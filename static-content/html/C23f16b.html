</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, June 16, 1723, covering a shipment of 13 hogsheads of tobacco on board Captain Bradley from lands that his son-in-law, Nathaniel Burwell, had a lifetime interest in but that belong to Carter, and which he will bequeath to one of his grandsons by his daughter, Burwell's widow.  He asks Perry to send him a separate account of the sale. He also sends 10 hogsheads of his own very good tobacco. He concludes that he will list some drafts that he and Mann Page have made on Perry.

</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] The <i>Micajah &amp; Philip 
</i>was a large vessel of some 400 tons carrying a crew of 27. The captain's name varies from record to record as James Bradley or James Bradby. Thomas Jones wrote to his wife, then in England, concerning this ship in 1728, "The Micajah &amp; Philip that comes to James River is as good as the best Ships that Comes hither, but Bradby the master seems to be a little conceited and prodigal."
