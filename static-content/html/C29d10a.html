</b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. Carter addresses Perry as "Alderman" because Perry had been elected an alderman of London in February 1728. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B22">Price.  <i>Perry of London. . . . 
</i>  p. 7.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Carter had extensive knowledge of the law, and may have used "tax" here to mean "To estimate or determine the amount of . . . to assess. . . ."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online

</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Inculcated means "to endeavour to force (a thing) into or impress (it) on the mind of another by emphatic admonition, or by persistent repetition; to urge on the mind, esp. as a principle, an opinion, or a matter of belief; to teach forcibly. . . ."   (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online

</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] Quit rent was the term used for "a (usually small) rent paid by a freeholder . . .  in lieu of services which might otherwise be required; a nominal rent paid (esp. in former British colonial territories to the Crown) as an acknowledgement of tenure," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
