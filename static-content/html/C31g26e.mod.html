</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The <i>Rebecca 
</i> was probably a London ship; she was of 300 tons, had a crew of 11, and was commanded by Samuel Malbon in 1731. ( Adm. 65/195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Vizt. is the abbreviation for the Latin word "videlicet";  it means "that is to say; namely; to wit: used to introduce an amplification, or more precise or explicit explanation, of a previous statement or word." (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary
</i>  online.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Thomas Woodward commanded the <i>Providence,
</i> a ship owned by Captain John Hyde &amp; Company, during a number of voyages to the colony, 1723-1729. ( Survey Report 6800 summarizing Adm. 68/194 and Survey Report 6801 summarizing Adm 68/195, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia,
</a> and  Carter's letter to the firm,  <a href="C23i17a.html"target="_wblank">September 17, 1723.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] The <i>Bailey
</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove 1730-1732. She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;
</a> A letter of Carter's to Dawkins <a href="C32e12b.html"target="_wblank">May 12, 1732,
</a> refers to "your ship Bailey." as does a letter of August 10, 1733, from Carter's executors to Dawkins. [ Lloyd T. Smith, Jr., <i>ed.

<br><br><a name="n5"> [5] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See  <a href="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm"target="_wblank">"Bill of Exchange"
</a> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.
