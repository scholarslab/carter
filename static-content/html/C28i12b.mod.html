<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]   In Carter's day, the muzzle loading weapons performed best when loaded with a spherical projectile manufactured by pouring drops of molten lead into a pool of water.  "Small shot had been made by the 'long drop into water'" method for around a hundred years" before the invention of the tower for that purpose by a Bristol man, William Watts, about 1780.
