</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, February 13, 1724, to enclose a bill  of lading for 50 hogsheads of tobacco. He comments on freight rates, the quality of his tobacco, and on 3 hogsheads that are poor because of a "Notorious rogue" of an overseer. He turns to the misfortune of Captain Adam Graves who has been ill and unable to seek cargo for his ship although he has now recovered, and notes that he  has made two large sloops available to Graves for moving tobacco to the ship. In conclusion, he adds that all the planters in the colony are expecting very good prices for their last shipments of stemmed tobacco.

</i> <br> <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been pretty  plentiful   to You already <br>Shall say the less now herein You have a bill of Lading for fifty hhds. <br>of my Crop Tobacco  which  I have  shipped   upon Your Charter, <a href="C24b13a.mod.html#n1">Keiling
</a> would <br>not Sign his bills under Eight pound Ten, although he did my other <br>Bills at Eight pound, In Yours of the 2d. of  August   You tell me You were <br>to have the freight as the rest of the Ship went, I hope You will Set this <br>Matter to rights with <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr. Perry
</a> &amp; do me justice, As I am not for <br>Sinking the freight too low, So I am as unwilling to give too much, <br>You may remember how <a href="Cbiodir.html#CS">Baily Kent
</a> fared by exacting 20  shillings    upon his <br>freight which  I am sure  proved   to the damage of the  Carter  some hundreds <br>of pounds, This Tobacco  in general I have taken all Imaginable care <br>to manage in the Best manner, &amp; I hope will rise as well as the Year <br>Affords, but I must Advertise You of three hhds. No. 32. 33. 34. that <br>are but Indifferent &amp; as indifferently  managed   My overseer was a Notori<br>=ous rogue &amp;  passed   this Tobacco  upon his Oath, I discoverd not his Villany <br> until   the Tobacco  was  marked &amp; ordered   away, You must do the best with <br>it You can, but pray let it not discredit the rest of my Goods.

</a><br><br><a name="n3"> [3] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
