</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Lord Fairfax, the under-age owner of, and William Cage, trustee for, the proprietary of the Northern Neck, in England, February 13, 1721, concerning his assumption of the lease and his attempts to getEdmund Jenings, the former agent, to settle his accounts. He requests a stronger power of attorney concerning the granting of lands as agent, and informs them that he has sent for their review a copy of the power he had held when he formerly was agent and hopes they will send him an equally strong one. He also needs the power to deal with escheats which he does not presently have. He intends to communicate often, as he hopes they will, but notes he will send the more tedious details through Micajah Perry and his son John.

</a> <br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have  een added for clarity.
</a> <br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Catherine Culpeper, widow of the fifth Lord Fairfax (d. 1710); from her father, the 2nd Lord Culpeper, she had inherited about 1689 his five-sixths interest in the <a href="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/users/Berkeley/#Northern Neck"target="_wblank">Northern Neck Proprietary
</a> in Virginia. Lord Fairfax consulted Micajah Perry about the affairs of the Propietary, and Perry had recommended Robert Carter to be the Virginia agent in 1702. He held the post until 1710 when Lady Fairfax transferred the agency to Edmund Jenings with Thomas Lee as the deputy agent. When she died in 1719, she bequeathed her Virginia property to her son Tom, but she made Wiliam Cage and Edward Filmer, tustees of the proprietary. Filmer soon died, and Cage, a kinsman of the 6th Lord Fairfax, became the sole trustee. From his grandmother, Margaret Lady Culpeper, the 6th Lord Fairfax inherited the other one-sixth of the roprietary. Cage consulted Perry, and Robert Carter was again made agent in 1721, holding the post until his death ten years later.
