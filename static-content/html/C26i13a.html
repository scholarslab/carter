<br><br><i><b>Source copy
consulted:

</i>
</b> This document is privately owned, and its owners
prefer to remain anonymous. 
</a><br><br>

<br><br>The document was folded and addressed on a blank portion of
the obverse leaf: "For his Majesty's Service | To | The Sherif of the
County of --  | Prince George." It was endorsed, presumably by the
clerk of Prince George County, "Proclamation | continuing Officers |
August 1726 --  | Published Sept. 13th 1726." It bears a very
large original signature of Robert Carter as is noted by the use of bold
italics. The document has been framed for many years, and there are
some wrinkles along the right side that prevent a clear reading of
several words.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  George Douglas-Hamilton (1666-1737), first earl of Orkney, a distinguished general in the British army. was rewarded in part for his service by being given by Queen Anne the sinecure of governor of Virginia in 1710, a title he held until his death in 1737. He never visited the colony but sent a succession of deputies as lieutenant governors. (Lawrence B. Smith. <a href="http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12069?docPos=4"target="_wblank">"Hamilton, George, first earl of Orkney"
