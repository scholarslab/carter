John Randolph Esqr<br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received your favour by the <a href="Cbiodir.html#JC">Secretary 
</a> &amp; am <br>
Sorry any Thing should fall out to deprive me of the Satisfaction <br>
I should have taken in your Company however seeing your Affairs <br>
would not Allow of it I am  pleased  that you take my Case so much <br>
to heart to  promise  that you will give it a deliberate Consideration <br>
In my Observations I think I was short in some things which I <br>
 believe  upon your Perusal of the papers you will hardly <br>
Slip over one is that in the Depositions of  Thomas  Carr and others <br>
that Were jury men when the line was made from the Cedar  in the law suit between <a href="C29i15b.mod.html#n1">Allerton
</a>
</i> and <br>
 Newton   <S><font color="red">as
</font>
</S> 
</i> were so hardly brought to agree to that Verdict do  <S><font color="red">without deposition
</font>
</S> <br>
declare that  there was
</i> no old lines  shown  to them nor any old  marked  tree  by Allerton
</i> and <br>
that nothing Else  Induced  them to agree to that Verdict at last but the <br>
Surveys assuring them that Allerton by that Survey would have less <br>
land than his  patent  gave him and this if I remember right <br>
they all say
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are  pleased  to desire my Custom for what Cash <br>
I shall have Occasion to take up for <a href="C29i15b.mod.html#n2">bills of  Exchange 
</a> at the Allowance <br>
of 20 per  Cent  upon this  Encouragement  I will have one two or Three <br>
hundred pounds of you and I shall be willing to take the more if you <br>
make no scruple to take some of the bills in  Glasgow  I am 

</p>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your  most  oobedient  Humble Servant.

<br><br>
If I should have Occasion to draw upon you before I see  [you]  I hope <br>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Willoughby Allerton (1664-1724) was a prominent citizen of Westmoreland County where he was burgess, sheriff, and militia officer.  ( <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~edburton/fam03055.htm"target="_wblank">Allerton Genealogical Data

<br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
