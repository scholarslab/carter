</a>
</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Francis Lee, August 20, 1706, that it seems that the tobacco shipped on board James Morgan's ship should fetch a good price since  "this long Stay of the Convoy hath very much raised the price of Tobo." He adds that the sons of Ralph Wormeley are expected with the next fleet and that their mother has engaged passage on Thomas Graves's ship. He reports bills of exchange drawn on Lee for impost on tobacco belonging to the Wormeley estate shipped on Benjamin Silvester's and Thomas Graves's ships.
