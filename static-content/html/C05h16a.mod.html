</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. John Shropshire writes fromWestmoreland County to Robert Carter, August 16, 1705, to introduce "Richard Tankersly, . . .  the son of Dr. Geo: Tankersly" whom he introduces to Carter as a suitable person to rent a plantation belonging to the estate of Ralph Wormeley. He adds in a postscript that he has heard rumors of the arrival of a new governor which he hopes is true, and mentions that he has suffered under Lt. Gov. Nicholson because he could not sign all the addresses, etc., which too many of his fellow ministers have.
