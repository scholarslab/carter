<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am indebted to you for your Letter of the 24th. of Octobr.<br>
 a very kind one it is.  Your advice in relation to my health and management of<br>
 my self in my infirmities is most  Obligeing  I have followed your advices in <br>
several respects I have drunk a great deal of  Spaw   water. I had some of the <br>
<a href="C29f27g.html#n2">Bristol water
</a> sent me from thence in which I have soaked myself very Plen=<br>
=tifully and I have also taken a preat deal of <sup><font color="green">your
</i>
</font>
</sup> receipt and Intend to Continue it <br>
but your directions to refrain Eating Butter every manner of way I think imposs<br>
ible to follow there being nothing  wee  eat but must have butter to make it savou<br>
ry and I dare say <a href="C29f27g.html#n3">Doctr. Bave
</a> himself can much Easier give this advice  then  <br>
take it, however I follow it as.much as reasonably I can with abundance of <br>
regularity and a great deal of Exercise with the use of frequent Purges of <a href="C29f27g.html#n4">And=<br>
=ersons pills
</a> I make a shift to keep my distemper at a tolerable Bay. the time of <br>
my greatest disturbance is about midnight when I am so frequently oppresed <br>
that I know not how to live the greatest of my Malady proceeds from wind Occ=<br>
= asiond  I conceit by a difficult and bad  digestion of my food sometimes my <br>
 fitts  are so violent heaving me into so much Confusion which makes me un<br>
fit for any business take away all my resolution distracts my mind &amp; <br>
fills me with ungovernable thoughts  rendring  all the  Idie's  of my soul in dark <br>
and  discourageing  Colours.which I have not the power to  dispell  by the Consid<br>
 eracions  of all the liberal mercys I am under which by the good hand of Providence<br>
I must own are not a few and when ever I transgress a little either in Eating <br>
or drinking to be sure that night I am to be miserably tormented.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Pratt was a London merchant and an old friend of Carter's who usually referred to him as "Daddy."

</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Carter refers to Dr. Samuel Bave (d. 1688) , "born in Cologne but trained at Oxford, specialized in the use of chalybeate waters and no doubt knew of the continental ones, for he was proficient in several languages."    (Phyllis May Hembry.  <i>The English Spa, 1560-1815: A Social History

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Anderson's Scots Pills, a product of the 1630's, had been invented by Patrick Anderson, a Scot, who wrote in a book published in 1635 that he had learned the secret of the pills in Venice. He passed the formula to his daughter Katherine who in turn passed it to a doctor named Thomas Weir in 1686. Weir obtained letters patent on the formula from James II in 1687. ( George B. Griffenhagen and James Harvey Young, "Old English Patent Medicines in America," in  <i>Contributions From the Museum of History and Technology

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] John Falconar (d. <i>ca.
</i> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See <a href="C27g24d.html"target="_wblank">Carter's letter to Falconar 
</a> of July 24 and August 22, 1727, for details about the payment of &pound;200 to him. See <a href="C30d16b.html"target="_wblank">Carter to William Dawkins,

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] The <i>Bailey

She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members.
