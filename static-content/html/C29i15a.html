 Tryal  you Could of the Value of this Ore what part of it might be <br>
Copper We have Since met with a Person  skilld  in these things <br>
who before our faces  hath  Extracted out of some of the best of it <br>
above a fourth Near a third of good Solid Copper which whets up <br>
<a href="C29i15a.html#n4">our humours

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This refiner for so he Calls himself tells us such men as we want <br>

Northward to whom he gave &pound;3 pound per month but thinks were they to be <br>
hired by the year they will take less if you oblige us to pay their Wages in <br>
the Curr't money of the Country it will be much Easier for us than Sterling <br>
which does not go in Our Currt. Payments Unless Expressly stipulated <br>
And it is necessary that a Clause be added in <a href="C29i15a.html#n5">the Indentures
</a> that if <br>
they do not understand the business they are hired for they would be en=<br>
titled to no wages or at least to no more than what is given to Common <br>

</b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. There is a nineteenth-century copy of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
</a>

<br><br>Because this letter is written in the plural and deals with the affairs of the Frying Pan Company that Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, and his sons Robert and Charles, organized for mining copper, it seems likely that Carter wrote it jointly.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page, organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Horsepen Run joins Broad Run on the northern border of Dulles airport. The company was not successful.

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] An indenture is a contract between two or more parties. It is so named because copies of such a contract in early times were often written at the top and the bottom of a sheet which was then cut apart in a jagged or indented manner. The copies could then be fitted together to prove autheiticity.   "The contract by which an apprentice is bound to the master . . . by which a person binds himself to service in the colonies, etc."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
