</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>January the 5th 1727 [1728]<br><br>Mr. James Carter -- <br> <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have Settled an Account  with John Wright  about  <a href="C28a05a.mod.html#n2">Waugh <br>Darnells
</a> Deed in Stafford  County  he  has  paid me all to 49  pounds . of  Tobacco  when <br>he pays you this  balance  you may let him have the Deed he Says that <br>besides the  composition  for the other deed of Waugh Darnells he paid the <a href="C28a05a.mod.html#n3">Quit <br>rents
</a> to <a href="C28a05a.mod.html#n4">John Allen
</a> your receiver and he has his receipt for it now <br>the  Quit  rents of the Land I have no Credit for or is the Land put into any <br>rent  roll  either yours or King George's he also tells me that Tom Stone <br>his neighbour  has  got his Deed in his whole Account  is 1101  pounds  of  Tobacco  <br>you have given me Credit but for 600, these mistakes  I hint to <br>you that you may set them to rights, You must always reckon <br>the  Quit  rents are due from the Date of the Deed and not from the time <br>of the Delivery for the delay in keeping the Deeds is  Occasioned  for <br>want of the payment of the  Composition  which is properly due from <br>the Date of the Deeds  <S><font color="red">upon the Letters and noats
</font>
</S>  it  has  been the <br>practice upon the Letters and  notes  of the upper Inhabitants for me <br>to Send them out  warrants  for the taking up Lands many of which <br>have never been Executed nor  returned  to me which  has  been a great <br>abuse to the <a href="C28a05a.mod.html#n5"> Proprietors 
</a> and I think for the future to Issue no no more  warrants  <br> until  the fees are paid which you know is 15/ for a  warrant  &amp; Entry <br>and if you Send down to me for any  warrants  to take care to let me <br>know that these fees are paid to you or if you know of any perons <br>coming for  warrants  you may Acquaint them unless they bring <br>their money they will loose their labour --

</a> you returnd a  Deliquent <br>as well as Several others of good Circumstances I am  informed  by <br>Several ways that Mr. Alexander holds a great deal more Land <br> than  he ever paid  Quit  rents for pray let him know this &amp; Desire <br>him in my name that he would Survey his lands that it may <br>be known in what Quantity he holds that the  Proprietors  may be no longer <br>abused or if he will not put himself to the Charge I hope he will <br>not be Offended if I order the Survey of it for him that I may grant <br>the Surplus to Some other person that will pay the  Quit  rents more <br>Punctually than he  has  done I will have you take care to <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
