<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Falconar (d. <i>ca.
</i> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See <a href="C27g24d.html"target="_wblank">Carter's letter to Falconar 
</a> of July 24 and August 22, 1727, for details about the payment of &pound;200 to him. See <a href="C30d16b.html"target="_wblank">Carter to William Dawkins,
</a> for Falconar's death date.  Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.

</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Captain Peter Wills commanded the  <i>Booth
</i> in 1723-1724, a ship belonging to merchant Thomas Colmore of London (see Carter's <a href="C24a29a.html"target="_wblank">letter
</a> to Colmore of January 20 and February 15, 1724), and the <i>Amity,
</i> a vessel of 500 tons and 21 men,  in 1727-1729. He is mentioned in Carter's diary in 1723.

<br><br><a name="n3"> []3 A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] John Pratt was a London merchant and an old friend of Carter's who usually referred to him as "Daddy."
</a>

<br><br><a name="n5"> [5] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<br><br><a name="n6"> [6] Benjamin Berryman (ca. 1680-1729) was the son of John and Jane Berryman and lived in Westmoreland County where he was justice and sheriff. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B10">McIlwaine.  <i>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .

<br><br><a name="n7">[7]  The <i>Bailey
</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members.

</a> A letter of Carter's to Dawkins <a href="C32e12b.html"target="_wblank">May 12, 1732,
