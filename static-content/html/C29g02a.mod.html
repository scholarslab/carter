<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The <i>Lee Galley
</i> was a vessel commanded by George Buckeridge in 1729. She was a vessel of 100 or 200 tons and 13 men.  ( Adm. 68/195, ff. 155v, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] The <i>Bailey
</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;
</a> A letter of Carter's to Dawkins <a href="C32e12b.html"target="_wblank">May 12, 1732,
</a> refers to "your ship Bailey." as does a letter of August 10, 1733, from Carter's executors to Dawkins. [ Lloyd T. Smith, Jr., <i>ed.
</i>  <i>The Executors' Letters of Robert Carter of Corotoman, 1732-1738. 
</i>  (Irvington, VA: Foundation for Historic Christ  Church, 2010) p. 76].

<br><br><a name="n4"> [4] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See  <a href="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm"target="_wblank">"Bill of Exchange"

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] George Ball (1683-1746) was a son of William Ball (1676-1744)  of Lancaster County, part of the prominent Ball faily of that county, but a resident of Northumberland County where he was a justice and sheriff.
