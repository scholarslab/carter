To Mrs. Jane Hyde<br>
 
<br>Madam<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  received   your  Obliging lines with my<br>
daughters  clothes  I  believe   your  Care was Extraordinary<br>
And the Genteelness and richness of the Silk  shows <br>
they were no bad pennyworth things are not so dear<br>
seems much better to fit the Circumstances of our Country<br>
not only for the Poorness of the Commodity we maintain<br>
ourselves by but from the seldom occasions we have for<br>
our gentry to Appear in fine  Clothes  A birth night &amp;<br>
a ball Coming but once a year so that rich  clothes <br>
before they are  Sullied  at all grow to be so much out of<br>
fashion that In two or three years time Even the wearers of<br>
them grow weary of them
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I continue to send for my Childrens things

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>
to your Father begging you will continue  your  favour in <br>
owing  your  Assistance in the buying and Packing them<br>
Genteelness and  cheapness  I always desire may be made<br>
the rule in my childrens Equipment

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
