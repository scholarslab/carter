</a><br><br>The name of Carter's home, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
</a><br><br>Because Carter's son-in-law, Mann Page lived in Gloucester County, just across the York River from Williamsburg, and because of the  affectionate tone of this letter, the editor believes that it was sent to Page, also a member of the Council.
</a><br><br>Most references cite the date of Daniel McCarty's death as 1724 <i>May
</i> 4, and cite his tombstone inscription: "Here lyeth the body of Daniel McCarty, who departed this life the fourth of May 1724 in the forty fifth year of his age. He was endowed with many virtues and qualifications, but the actions proceeding therefrom bespeak their praise."  (See, for instance, <a href="Cbibl.html#B1">Kukla.  <i>Speakers and Clerks. . . .
</i>  p. 100.
</a> The inscription is quoted from an email, 2002 July 30, William M. McCarty to the editor. Dr. McCarty has been working on a book on the McCarty family for some sixty years.)
</a><br><br>There is no indication in the minutes of the Council that Eskridge was given the post that Carter sought for him. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B10">McIlwaine.  <i>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .
</i> , 4[1721-1739].
