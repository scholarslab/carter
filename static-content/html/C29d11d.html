<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, April 11, 1729, reporting the arrival of several "Packetts" from the merchant, commenting on the poor market for tobacco, alerting Pemberton about a mistake that he has made in marking some hogheads that belong to another account, directing him to charge protested bills of exchange from the <i>Rose
</i> slave sale to his personal account, and enclosing (not present) a bill of lading for 25 hogsheads of his own tobacco. On June 20th he drafts a post script to add a bill of lading (not present) for 3 hogsheads more.

</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] There  were several vessels with the name <i>Rappahannock
</i>.  One was based in Liverpool and was commanded by a Captain Francis Etheridge in 1725; she was a 90 ton ship with 13 men. Another of which Charles Whate was captain was of 60 tons with 11 men in 1726 and 1727. Carter's letters mention a Captain Hugh Brackhill in 1728-1729, and Captain Loxum in 1733. ( Adm. 68/194, ff.30, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter refers to the sales of slaves from Pemberton's ship, the <i>Rose,
</i> for which he had been the agent in the colony. See his letters to Pemberton in 1728 for more information.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3"> [4] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

 <br><br><a name="n4"> [4] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See  <a href="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm"target="_wblank">"Bill of Exchange"
</a> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.

</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] A Captain Leatherland commanded the <i>William &amp; James
</i> in June 20, 1729, and the <i>Samuel &amp; Jane
</i> in 1732. (( <a href="C29d11e.html"target="_wblank">Carter
to the freighters
</a> of the ship <i>Rose,
</i> April 11 and June 29, 1729,
</a> and  <a href="C32g13a.html"target="_wblank">Carter to Pemberton
</a> July 13, 1732.
