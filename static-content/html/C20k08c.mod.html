Measures as farr as will be Consistent with the Countrysability." He turns to Edmund Jenings who has made promises, andCarter states that "If he will not I'll endeavour to make him when Iam full Impowerd." He adds that there are rumors that Jenings is tobe Secretary [of the colony] but that his commission has not beenproduced.
