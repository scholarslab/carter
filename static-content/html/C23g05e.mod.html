</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his son, Robin (Robert Carter, Jr.), then in England at school, July 5, 1723, that he was sorry not have had a letter from him on the <i>Carter,
</i> but understands he was away when she sailed. He reviews the arrangements for Robin's return to the colony if he has not already sailed because merchant William Dawkins has kept Robin longer in England than Carter intended. He concludes that Robin's brother Charles may return with him or stay as he chooses.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
