</a><br><br>The preceding leaf or leaves of the letterbook havebeen lost. From the context, it is clear that this letter wasaddressed to RC's oldest son John, then in London studying law. Thenext letter in the letter book bears the date which has beententatively assigned to the closing portion of this letter.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The return address, county, and colony have beenadded for clarity to this letter fragment.
