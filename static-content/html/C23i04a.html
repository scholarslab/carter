</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, September 4, 1723, reminding the merchant that he shipped 51 hogsheads on board Capt. Bowman's ship and that he hopes for a better price for it than last year's. He orders cloth, sugar, and boots, and will add claret, burgundy, and champagne provided his tobacco sells at a price that he specifies.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on July 4, 1723, that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.
</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on March 4, 1726,  when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] James Read (Reid) is not referred to as "captain" which means he was an official of John Stark's firm on a trading vessel who was empowered to do its business in Virginia. He was aboard the <i>Charles,
</i> a Glasgow ship that was owned by Stark, by which this letter was sent. 
</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Carter may have been referring to a fabric made in the <a href="http://www.scottish-towns.co.uk/borders/galashiels/index.html">Scots town of Galashiels
</a>. "This bustling manufacturing town is pleasantly situated with the Gala Water flowing through its heart. There have been mills here since the early 17th century. . . . " ( See http://www.scottish-towns.co.uk/borders/galashiels/index.html, 2/5/2010
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] A half-jack was a boot ending below the knee with turned down top of a softer and lighter colored leather, pulled on by leather or string loops on each side. (William W. Burke, "Dictionary of 18th Century Clothing Terms." <a href="http://www.nwta.com/patterns/pdfs/111dict.pdf">NWTA Patternmaster Document 111
