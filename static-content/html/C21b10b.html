</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, Sr., and his grandson, February 10, 1721, to ask their assistance in pressing Colonel William Cage, trustee under the will of Lady Fairfax, and the underage heir, the current Lord Fairfax, concerning his procedure in granting lands in the Northern Neck proprietary, for which Carter has taken a lease as agent. He also is concerned about the Brent Town grant and its unsurveyed borders and wants the properitors' instructions concerning a survey because the lack of one scares Virginians from settling in the area. He is also concerned about a 14,000-acre grant that he presumes if owned by Sir Jeffrey Jeffreys, MP. Carter informs the Perrys that he has written details of these matters to his son John in London and directed John to pursure thesematters.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Written on the page at this point are several words -- "then" and "Mr. Perry C and so," and at the beginning of the next line, "the" --  in the clerk's hand.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n2">[2] The complicated affairs of the <a href="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/#Brent"target="_wblank">Brent Town grant
</a> may be reviewed in the section "Brent Town Within the Proprietary" linked from the opening screen of this web site.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n4">[4] The 14,000-acre grant was originally made to Cadwallader Jones and later taken over by John Jeffreys (1614-1688), master of the Grocers Company and London alderman in 1661, to whom Jones was in debt. Jeffreys was in business with his nephew, Sir Jeffrey Jeffreys, MP, who was his heir, and it is to him that Carterrefers. ( J. R. Woodhead,  <i>The Rulers of London.
