</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, February 15, 1724, to complain about the last shipment of slave shoes from him because the shoemaker -- "a rank cheat " -- had marked sizes as larger than they were. He orders replacement shoes to be "the best Strong plain Carmens Shoos that You can buy for Money."

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

</a> <br><br><a name="n2">[2] According to a variety of sources on the web including the  <i>Encyclopedia Britannica Online, 
</i> French falls were a type of high buff leather boots with a wide top that was turned over forming a cuff around the leg. P.A. Bruce wrote in his  <i>Economic History of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century
</i>  "The Assembly had, in 1660, adopted rules . . .  Each county was instructed to erect a tan-house and to employ tanners, carriers, and shoemakers. There was appointed for each house an overseer . . . To the persons presenting hides he was required to sell plain shoes at the rate of thirty pounds [of tobacco] a pair. French falls of the largest size were to be sold to such persons at the rate of thirty-five pounds [of tobacco] a pair, whilst those of the smallest were to be sold at twenty pounds."  A knowledgeable staff member at Colonial Williamsburg has emailed the editor "The main puzzlement is, that French Falls were made for men, women, and children, and for well over 100 years.  No one can fathom any known style or type of footwear that fits that description with certainty, at that price range, that's not slippers. The leading UK footwear historian, June Swann, has never found a definitive answer as to what they were either.  Maybe one day we'll figure it out."  ("Classics of American Colonial History," ttp://www.dinsdoc.com/bruce-1-0a.htm; 5/1/2007; p. 482; and email, Dominic Saguto to the editor, 5/22/2007)
