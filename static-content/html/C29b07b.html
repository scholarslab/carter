<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the desire of your last letter I have discoursed <a href="C29b07b.html#n2">Mr. Warner
</a> <br>at large upon your Affair having before us the several letters relating thereto <br>I find my not sending a  Warrt  to Mr. Warner according to your first desire was <br> Cheifly  upon two reasons first upon the Looseness and uncertainty of your entry <br>mentioning no  boundarys  only two <a href="C29b07b.html#n3">runs
</a> in which Mr. Warner tells me <br>there cant be so Little as ten thousand acres as he reckons that are ungranted <br>A second reason was that from the information both of your self and others <br>the Land you are aiming at was within Joness  <S><font color="red">bounds
</font>
</S>  alias <sup><font color="green">Jeofferys

</font>
</sup>  Pattent  my <br>province is only to grant Lands that have not been granted before I am not a <br>Judge to determine upon the Validity of  pattents  I have receiv'd <a href="C29b07b.html#n4">quitrents
</a> once <br>for <a href="C29b07b.html#n5">Jeofferys's  Pattent.

</a> made his entry with me bounding it <br>on three sides with other mens Lines suggesting it as Land ungranted where <br>upon I sent him a Warrant in which I think no injustice was done to you
</p>

Connels Survey being within the purview of <br>your caveat I shall observe the same method in.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Mercer (1704-1768) emigrated from Ireland where he had been trained as an attorney. "He settled at Marlboroughtown [in then Stafford County] in 1726 as a practicing attorney and at once allowed a facile pen to get him into trouble with the government." He eventually lost his license to practice law, and turned to the land speculation that he had begun as soon as he reached Virginia. "He married first on June 10, 1725 Catherine Mason (June 21, 1707-June 15, 1750) only child of Colonel George Mason (16??-1716) and his second wife Elizabeth Waugh, daughter of the Reverend Mr. John Waugh."(<a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks of Old Prince William

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Quit rent was the term used for "a (usually small) rent paid by a freeholder . . .  in lieu of services which might otherwise be required; a nominal rent paid (esp. in former British colonial territories to the Crown) as an acknowledgement of tenure," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] The Jeffries family owned much land in Virginia, especially Sir Jeffrey Jeffreys, MP, heir to the business affairs of his uncle, John Jeffreys (1614-1688), master of the Grocers Company and alderman in 1661.
