</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict Leonard Calvert, new governor of the province of Maryland, writes to Robert Carter, August 22, 1727, concerning the steps taken within that colony to ensure that persons accused of robbery of William Thacker in Virginia will appear at their Virginia trial. He notes that Thacker appears to have fled from debts he owned in Maryland, and his debtors rashly pursued him into Virginia.

Carter probably had the letter copied for his reference because it was an official one that would have to be placed among the records at the capital in Williamsburg. The address has been copied from the foot of the letter into the address line at the head of the letter.
