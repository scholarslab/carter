</center><br><center><h3> <br><br> <i>Letter from Robert Carter to John Stark, August 8 and 15, 1723
</i> 
</a>
</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, August 8, 1723, referring to an earlier letter concerning a draft on Stark. He then alerts Stark that he will ship 50 hogsheads on board Captain Bowman's ship, and that James Read's solicitations for more on board Stark's ship, the <i>Charles,
</i> he probably will agree to, but he hopes Stark will obtain a better price for the tobacco than last year's. He complains strongly about the difference in weight of his tobacco when he weighs it just before shipping it, and when it is weighed by Stark. Carter wants Stark to send good claret to his daughter, Elizabeth Burwell on York River, but complains about the price charged those men who received claret from him this year.  In a lengthy post script dated August 15, 1723, Carter encloses a bill of lading (not present) for 51 hogsheads of tobacco, complains that Stark did not allow him the farthing per pound more that he gave others, orders brandy for his daughter, and tells Stark that his masters will tell him more of the damage to crops from the recent bad weather.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on 1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.
</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on March 4, 1726,  when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] James Read (Reid) is not referred to as "captain" which means he was an official of John Stark's firm on a trading vessel who was empowered to do its business in Virginia. He was aboard the <i>Charles,
</i> a Glasgow ship that was owned by Stark. Carter specifically refers to "Your Ship" and "the Charles of Glasgow" in a letter to Stark of <a href="C23i04a.html"target="_wblank">September 4, 1723.
</a> 
</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Carter knew of the long conection of the Pontac family with the Haut-Brion vineyards, and the wines produced in that region that came to be known as clarets. ( <xref to="26">"Chateau Haut-Brion"
</a> at http://www.haut-brion.com/home/en/fiches/chb.php, found 4/16/02
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] Peter How was a merchant of Whitehaven (on the Irish sea in northwest England), who, with Richard Kelsick, traded with the Fredericksburg, Virginia, area from the early 18th century, establishing a store there in 1745. "He had interests in coal and iron-ore mines and set up an iron-working forge at Low Mill [England] in 1750. Debts incurred by the forge and the decline in the tobacco trade may have contributed to his bankruptcy in 1763." ( Paula S. Felder.
