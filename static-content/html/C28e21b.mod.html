</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to [Governor William Gooch,] May 21, 1728, to send by his son Charles a commission for the governor's signature that will renew Carter's post as escheator of the Northern Neck. He alerts the governor that the county courts of Stafford and Northumberland will not sit until they receive new commissions as more than six months have passed since the death of the king. He encloses a list (not present) in which he has listed the members of each court, their "abilitys," "Characters," and where they live, and offers to send new commissions to these courts should they be ready before Charles leaves town.
