</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Gloucester County resident Captain Francis Willis, December 9, 1723, concerning the estate of Carter's  deceased niece's husband, John Lloyd, who left Virginia for England after her death, and whose Virginia estate Carter has managed. Willis's son Francis has told Carter that the Lloyd estate is indebted to his father, and that the latter might be interested in selling his interest. Carter assures Willis that he would like  to acquire that interest if Willis can give him good title.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad but his clerk has entered that return address for this letter to another resident of Virginia. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br>Carter has added three words of the complimentary close in his own hand as the use of italics shows.
