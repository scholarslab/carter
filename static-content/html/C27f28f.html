</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, June 28, 1727, to order some goods for the late Nathaniel Burwell's family and to enclose several bills of exchange. He comments that many merchant ships have sailed from the colony without waiting for the convoys, and the colony's government has accordingly established an embargo to force the ships into convoys. He mentions the needs of the Lloyd estate and that he had hoped to be able to send an invoice for goods but circumstances have prevented him. In a lengthy post script dated July 26, 1727, Carter repeats his notice of bills of exchange of which he had notified Perry in an earlier letter, and sends  a statement of Edmund Jenings's account with the Proprietors of the Northern Neck which shows a balance due Carter which he hopes will be credited against his next rent payment. He also reports Jenings's death on July 5, 1727. In a second post script dated August 22, 1727, Carter reports a bill of exchange for his daughter, Elizabeth Burwell Nicholas, and sends a bill of lading for tobacco belonging to the Lloyd estates. He notifies Perry that his grandson, Lewis Burwell, has been given permission to remain at school one more year before going to university, and that he has drawn bills on Perry payable to John Falconar and John Pemberton. None of the enclosures mentioneed in the letter are present.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
</a><br><br><a name="n1"> [1] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
