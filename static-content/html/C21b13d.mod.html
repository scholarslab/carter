</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants Micajah Perry Sr. andJr., February 13, 1721, that he has received their letters which werefull of bad news concerning the poor quality of the tobacco he hassent to them for sale. He argues that he has sent them good tobacco,especially that shipped by Captain Wharton, and that there willalways be good and bad tobacco in every crop and shipment. He writesabout the Northern Neck proprietary affairs and his need for anaccount before he can take Edmund Jenings to court for his unpaiddebts to the proprietors. Charles Grymes has talked of his takingover the management of the Lloyd properties, but the overseers havecome to Carter to renew their yearly contracts. In conclusion hecomplains about the poor prices her received for tobacco shipped "perLisband" and hopes he will not lose much from his annuity.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity.

</a><br><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Louis Wright has speculated that Mr. Pratt mightbe William Pratt of Gloucester County as there were several Prattsactive in Virginia at this time. In his letter to Micajah and RichardPerry written 13 July 1720, Carter noted that "Mr. Pratt took care ofthose [letters] for James rivr &amp; York" which makes Wright'sspeculation as good as any. In the close-knit society of his time andclass, RC would certainly have learned what others were receiving fortheir crops, but a definite identification of the irritating Mr.Pratt is not possible.
