</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker,September 28, 1720, reporting that "throughout the Country aplentifull Crop is made" which he hopes will not affect prices fortobacco. He had an agreement with Captain Russel to make use of someof Russel's tobacco in payment for "Some Barbados goods" but itproved unnecessary. He sends a bill of exchange from Sam Heath, andhopes that Russel will bring him "some of the right sort of the ale"on his next voyage.
