<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Thomas, Lord Fairfax, proprietor of the Northern Neck, May 21, 1730, concerning a lease Fairfax has given Bristol merchants, noting that he had encouraged them but told them it would be some time before Fairfax would receive any profits from their venture. He turns to the attempt he and his family are mking to exploit signs of copper, but notes their discouragement. He understands that Fairfax will consult with Michajah Perry about defending the boundaries of the proprietary, and a new lease of it for Carter. The reports of iron mining are not to be relied upon because the cost of transporting the ore is very high. He turns to attacks  in the colony upon the proprietary, noting that there may be action when the Assembly meets soon since there have already been attempts to change the boundaries.

The Rt.. Honorable<br>

<br>My Lord<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honour you did me in a letter of the 9th of Novr<br>last did not reach my hands 'till the 9th of March. in it you are<br>pleas'd to acquaint me with the  Leas  you had transacted with some<br> Bristol  Merchts and to desire me to permit them to work unmolested from<br>whence I conjecture they had given yr Lordship information of some<br> desturbance  I had  threatned  them with if they have said any thing of<br>this nature to your Lordship 'tis a very wrong charge I was so far<br>from discouraging that I encourag'd them all I could in their design. One<br>of their partners here Offer'd to compound with me for your Lordship['s]

</a> one of their part=<br>ners I told him I was glad that your Lordship had made such a<br>favourable step to their design but I believe twill be a great While before<br>any benefit by this  leas  will arise to your Lordship the Undertakers<br>have made very little progress yet and have not sent  [<i>sic

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my letter to your Lordship of the 24th of June<br>last  amongst  many other things I gave you an Account of this place<br>where the Bristol men are upon and also of another that had some<br> shews  of Copper this other place  lyes  high up  Potomack  and far from<br>water <a href="C30e21a.html#n2">some others of my family

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the latter part of your  Lordships  letter you Acquaint<br>me that When <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr. Perry

What these complaints may be  Workt  up to in our Assembly which  sits<br>down to day I  cant  pretend to tell I have already told yr Lordship what<br>potent enemies our <a href="C30e21a.html#n4">revenue gentlemen
</a> were against the boundaries<br>&amp;ca. and there's no Doubt to be made but their utmost strength will be<br>imploy'd in Carrying this Complaint to the highest Pitch their<br>fingers itch to have this grant added to their places and I have rea=<br>son to think that these disturbances have much encourag'd the inha<br>bitants to be very backward in paying in their rents  altho  I am forc'd<br>to take them in tobo and that not to be sold now for 3 S per hundr'd<br>for I never had so few of the rents receiv'd at this time of year before<br>Since I have been in the business
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my own part in my justification I can say<br>I have made no Alteration in anything relating to the Execution<br>of the Grant nor is anything done but What is Very  justifyable   undr <br>it I observe the same measures in all my demands as I have done<br>ever since I was concern'd and as the  rist  of the agents before me did

Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.

In the 60s and 70s AD a town grew up on the site of Bath . . .In the late 17th century Bath continued to be a quiet market town. It largely depended on its springs. From 1661 Bath water was bottled and sold. . . . In the 18th century Bath became a much more genteel and fashionable place. It boomed in size. This was largely due to the efforts of Richard 'Beau' Nash 1674-1762 who was made Master of Ceremonies. Many fine buildings were erected in Bath. . . . A Pump Room was built in 1706. . . . During the Summer Georgian Bath was full of rich visitors. They played cards, went to balls and horse racing, went walking and horse riding. However the high life was only for a small minority."
