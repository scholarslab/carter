</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to William Robertson, June 2, 1727, clerk of the Council, asking him to review a letter and give "Mr. Cary" advice "in the Duty of his Office" as a friend because Cary "Seems not yet well to understand." He sends Robertson all the news he has received from letters and gazettes just arrived concerning the siege of Gibraltar and concerns in Britain.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Monsieur De Palm apparently was the representative of the ruler of Austria, Charles VI (Holy Roman Emperor [1711-1740] )  in Great Britain at the time. "Count Sinzendorf, Chancellor of the Court of his Imperial and Catholic Majesty" wrote to the envoy February 20, 1727, "His Imperial and Catholick Majestie judges it indispensably necessary, upon the step which has been lately taken in the country where you are, to send you, in the dispatch here annexed, a memorial which you are to present to the King of Great Britain, and to publish afterwards, that the whole nation may be acquainted with it, whilst answers are preparing to certain pamphlets, published before the opening of the Parliament."  De Palm complied with these instructions and published the letter and the memorial.  The problem for DePalm was that the assertions in the memorial contradicted those made by the King of England to Parliament in January.  "In his speech from the throne, he affirmed the existence of a secret treaty between the courts of Vienna and Madrid, and specified the leading articles, -- the recovery of Gigraltar, and the re-establishment of the Pretender."  De Palm was sent home immediately for his impertinence.  ( George Moore.  <i>Lives of Cardinal Alberoni, and the Duke of Ripperda. . . .

However, Spain was never happy with the loss, and had threatened, and then laid siege to Gibraltar in March 1727. The effort was unsuccessful and abandoned in June of that year. The treaty of Seville of 1729 ceded Gibraltar to Britain. ( "Gibraltar" http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Gibraltar.html  5/28/2003
