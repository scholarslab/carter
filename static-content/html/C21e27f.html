</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants Micajah Perry, Senior, and his grandson of the same name, May 27, 1721, complaining about the low sales of several hogsheads of tobacco, and stating that he expects his crops will be sold at as good prices as other gentlemen in the colony are receiving for large lots of tobacco. He hopes that a verbal message he recceived the day before about action in Parliament to remedy the effects of the South Sea Company scandals will prove to be true. Freight rates for ships in the York River have fallen to &pound;8 which he attributes to the merchants' custom of forcing planters to pay the freight. Captain Wharton maintains he won't accept below &pound;10 and Carter has sent aboard 90 hogsheads, transporting them to the ship in his own sloops; the ship has gone up the Rappahannock to Hobb's Hole. Slave sales are brisk at Tindall's Point, and Carter is relieved that he has not as yet had any bills protested for his work as agent for the sale of slaves imported on the <i>Mercury
</i>. There are about 40 ships presently in the Rappahannock and as many in other rivers. He tells the Perrys that they will learn about the threats to these ships from pirates from those reaching England. He looks forward to an account current they have promised.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony  have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Francis Willis (d. <i>post
</i> 1749) of Ware Parish, Gloucester County, who served as burgess. ( "Willis Family."  <i>William and Mary Quarterly.
</i>  1st ser. 5(1896): 24-27, 171-176; 6(1897): 27-29, 206-214.)
</a>
</a><br><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter refers to the scandal of the value of the stock of the South Sea and other companies which wild speculation had driven enormously high in June 1720, and which was nearly worthless several months later. Many fortunes were made and lost. Perhaps the most succesful speculator was Sir Robert Walpole who made a fortune, retired, and then was called to save the nation as prime minister, a post he held from 1721 until 1742.

</a><br><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Hobb's Hole in Essex County is today called Tappahannock.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n5">[5] The year before Carter had acted as one of two agents for the sale of a cargo of slaves sent into the colony on the <i>Mercury
</i> by the slave traders Francis Chamberlayne and Francis Sitwell. See his letters to them of <a href="C20g26a.html"target="_wblank">July 26
</a> and <a href="C20g27a.html"target="_wblank">27,
</a> and <a href="C20i27c.html"target="_wblank">September 27, 1720,
</a> and <a href="C23g02a.html"target="_wblank">July 2, 1723
</a>. Carter was concerned that some of the bills of exchange that he had accepted might not be good (protested).
</a><br><br><br><a name="n6">[6] In 1660, the English government chartered a company called the "Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa." The Company did not fare well, due mainly to the war with Holland, and in 1667, it collapsed. But out of its ashes emerged a new company: The Royal African Company. Founded in 1672, the Royal African Company was granted a . . . monopoly in the slave trade. Between 1680 and 1686, the Company transported an average of 5,000 slaves a year. . . .  In 1698, Parliament . . . opened the slave trade to all. With the end of the monopoly, the number of slaves transported on English ships would increase dramatically -- to an average of over 20,000 a year. By the end of the 17th century, England led the world in the trafficking of slaves.
