<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Benjamin Grayson of Prince William County, July 13, 1731, to give him instructions about his supervision of work at the Frying Pan mine and its workers whom Carter believes to be lazy and rogues. Apparently Grayson is selling sugar and rum for Carter as well.

Mr Benja Grayson,<br>
 


<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already  writ  you a Long Lr in relation to the <a href="C31g13b.html#n2">miners
</a> &amp; given<br>
you full Instructions how to proceed with them. I now come to your Jour=<br>
nal, which I must needs have you continue; but I would have you a little<br>
more particular, tht is, to make an Accot of the  Holidayes  &amp; Absent  Dayes   -- <br>
&amp; pieces of  Dayes  of every Miner; for I shall think it but reasonable tht they<br>
should discount out of their wages all their  mispent  Time. We pay  thm <br>
for  Holidayes  &amp;  Saturdayes  &amp; Saturdays in the Afternoon as well as <sup><font color="green">for
</i>
</font>
</sup> other <br>
working  Dayes.  If you make <sup><font color="green">out
</i>
</font>
</sup> ths accot monthly, it will be easy upon a slight <br>
view to cast up how many  mispent   Dayes  each Man is to accot for as for <br>
Hawes &amp; Brunton, I look upon them in another Manner our Servants -- <br>
as I have said enough to you of them already. I herewith send you a Copy <br>
of a letter signed by Brunton, Honey, Whitford &amp; Haweis, tht you may see wht <br>
Rogues they are; &amp; what Fools Whitford &amp; Honey are to let the other two <br>
shelter themselves under the Character tht they brought with thm from <br>
<a href="Cbiodir.html#FT">Falmouth.
</a> Howeis &amp; Brunton were fellows hired in  London . Idle --  <br>
Villains tht were in want of Bread.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have  overhawled  your several accots &amp; find nineteen pounds <br>
&amp; a Qr. of Sugr, thirty gallons of Rum disposed of. If I remember right I <br>
ordered the sugar not to be sold for less than ten pence. The Rum, considering <br>
the great Loss, is not dear. I sent you forty Galls &amp; you have sold but thirty <br>
but certainly, if it came safe to you, you might have drawn it off with less <br>
Loss. By your Accot you have the greater part of the sugar by you still  --  <br>
I shall go nearby the  Scooner  to adventure another Cask of rum to you --  <br>
to try if you can make a better hand another time.  Methinks  you give <br>
a very Strange Accot of the Expence of the Carpenter's <sup><font color="green">time
</i>
</font>
</sup> I can think of nothing <br>
more, that they have done since the Barn, but getting the Barrel Stuff  --  <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some

some stuff for Timbering the <a href="C31g13b.html#n3">Holes
</a> &amp; a little sawing, for a great many <br>
months together, &amp; now you tell me they have three weeks sawing still <br>
Pray let me have them forthwith to Building for my son. If there would <br>
want a Tobo house at <a href="C31g13b.html#n4">Cub Run
</a> for the Crop, you had best set them to do tht --  <br>
first. You should continue to set tht house, where there is a large Qty of good <br>
Land round; however contriving tht it may stand so near to the Qr to be of <br>
usefulness to it. I believe there wants a negro Qr <sup><font color="green">there
</i>
</font>
</sup> as much as anything <br>
Certainly, if they are no better employed than they have been, we must ex= <br>
pect nothing at all from their Work. Neale is a very Idle Rogue; you <br>
should give him a Great deal of Drubbing, &amp; make him stand in fear of <br>
you. The negroes surely must spent a great deal of their Time in <br>
making Pails &amp; <a href="C31g13b.html#n5"> Piggons 
</a> &amp; Churns for Merchandizing <a href="C31g13b.html#n6">Manuel
</a> tells <br>
me the smith does a great many Jobs for the neighbours. I hope he does  --  <br>
not work for nothing. He can never be employed at third of his Time <br>
in the work of the mine. I shall endeavour to supply you by the  scooner  &amp; <br>
am your Friend --  --

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Benjamin Grayson was, according to Fairfax Harrison, "one of the earliest of the Scots merchants to be established on Quantico, where Dumfries was to arise." He was appointed a justice of Prince William County in November 1731. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks. . . .

<br><br><a name="n2">[2]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful. From this letter it is apparent that Carter had hired Grayson to supervise the work being done at the mine. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B32">Morton.  <i>Robert Robert Carter of Nomini Hall.
