<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have understood you have both behaved your selves in<br>
a very  Villanous  &amp; base Manner; not like such Servants as you are  -- <br>
by your <a href="C31g13c.html#n2">Indentures
</a>, tht is Diggers in the Mines. I have therefore thought it <br>
proper to send to <a href="C31g13c.html#n3">Mr Grayson
</a> Copies of your Indentures, that he may know <br>
 tht  you are our Servants for four years from the Time of your Arrival into the<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Countrey

 Countrey;  &amp; that, if you do not know how to behave your Selves as Servants,  -- <br>
that he should make you do it by Correction suitable to your <a href="C31g13c.html#n4">Deserts
</a>. And to<br>
that End I do hereby let you know that I do appoint him your Master in <br>
the Absence of Me or of my sons, giving him the same Power over  yo   we have<br>
you pretend to  Holidayes  &amp; what not; but I forbid it you &amp; order him to<br>
make you work  dayly,  as the Rest of my servants  tht  are there do day by day,<br>
keeping no more  Holidayes  on <sup><font color="green">non

</font>
</sup>  Saturdayes  in the afternoon than they do  --  <br>
It seems one of you (Haweis) is a very  prophane  Rogue, curses his<br>
Meat &amp; us that are his Masters. I order Mr Grayson not to let you have so <br>
much Meat as you have had. And, seeing you have abused the Kindness you <br>
have met with, to treat you in a worse manner than you have been, &amp; <br>
give you sound <a href="C31g13c.html#n5">Drubbings
</a> suitable to your Merits. You shall know you <br>
have Masters  tht  will not be fooled by You, but will use the proper way, <br>
with you to bring you to better Manners.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] As is clear from this letter, and the two of this date to Benjamin Grayson, Howeis and Brunton were indentured servants Carter had hired through his agents in London to come to Virginia to work in the Frying Pan Copper mines that Carter and his sons were developing.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] An indenture is a contract between two or more parties. It is so named because copies of such a contract in early times were often written at the top and the bottom of a sheet which was then cut apart in a jagged or indented manner. The copies could then be fitted together to prove autheiticity.   "The contract by which an apprentice is bound to the master . . . by which a person binds himself to service in the colonies, etc."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
