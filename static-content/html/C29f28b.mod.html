<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, June 28, 1729, to report shipments of tobacco from himself and the Burwell estate on the <i>Bailey,
</i> and to inform the merchant that he remains interested in holding a share in a new vessel in the Virginia tobacco trade. He informs Dawkins of a number of bills of exchange, the conclusion of "your Affair with Mr. Lee," his approval of "your Chastizements of my son Robert" for his sloppy business practices, and that he has received "the Widdow Hutchins's Obligation for your Debt."

</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>June the 28th. 1729<br><br>
Mr. Wm. Dawkins<br>
per  Bailey 
 
<br>Sir -- <br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now taking niy leave of <a href="C29f28b.mod.html#n1">Adam Graves.
</a> he is a<br> 
full ship  has  left me out 3 hogsheads  of  Tobacco 
 that was  designed  for you you have<br> 
now a <a href="C29f28b.mod.html#n2">bill of Lading
</a> for 41  hogsheads   there is a mistake In the mark of 17 of them<br> 
they want the B of the back side, but they are all my own Crops they came down<br> 
from my Plantations just as the ship was full  we  were In such  haste  that  we  quite<br> 
forgot marking them of the right mark, 
</p>   

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a letter I  wrote  to you dated the <a href="C28j12a.html"target="_wblank">12th. of  October  last
</a><br> 
(I give it you in the very words.) I  believe   you'll  think it for  your  Interest to have<br> 
"a small ship here In <a href="C29f28b.mod.html#n3">this river
</a> early for this Crop. I expect the  <a href="Cbiodir.html#CS">Carter
</a>  will be sold<br> 
"I have been so indifferently used in her that I have often taken up resolutions<br> 
"never to be  Concerned  in any other. however taking Tom Dove to be a very honest<br>
"fellow and being willing to be a Contributor towards another ship for him<br>
"if you will build a new ship of about 5 or 600  hogsheads  and calling her after my<br> 
"name to be a standing ship for this river I will hold an eighth in her. This<br> 
"ship I cant Expect can be got ready for this crop but may very well be made<br> 
"an early ship against the next to Continue Tom Dove in business in the<br> 
"mean time if you will think it proper to send him in a small ship In=<br>
"differently Early I should think he cant miss of geting full I will do him<br> 
"all the service I can,
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Letter I sent away by one <a href="C29f28b.mod.html#n4">Naylor
</a> a   Liverpool   man<br> 
who it is reported  has  never been heard of and not finding you take any<br> 
notice of it suppose it was lost Dove it seems  has  proved himself so notorious<br> 
a Villain that I  believe  neither you nor any of his friends will have any<br> 
thing more to do with him and Indeed if the reports of him be true he deserves<br> 
the Abhorrence of Mankind. 
</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still Contented to be  Concerned  in a new ship to <br>
use this river to be of the Burthen above mentiond and to wear my name<br> 
and to hold an eighth in her, Adam Graves I would also  Choose  to be  Master <br> 
of her and he seems to be desirous of it for the love of his father and himself<br> 
too  he
</i>  has  a better Interest among us then any other you can send,
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein I send you my invoice for the goods I design to have<br> 
from you next Year,  Desiring  in the buying and shiping them you will<br> 
follow the directions therein given.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

<br><br><a name="n1"> [1] The <i>Bailey
</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members.

</a> A letter of Carter's to Dawkins <a href="C32e12b.html"target="_wblank">May 12, 1732,
</a> refers to "your ship Bailey." as does a letter of August 10, 1733, from Carter's executors to Dawkins. [ Lloyd T. Smith, Jr., <i>ed.

<br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online

</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Carter sent letters by Captain Naylor of a Liverpool ship in the fall of 1728, but apparently the ship was lost because Carter noted to William Dawkins<a href="C29f28b.mod.html"target="_wblank"> June 29, 1729
</a>, the ship "hath never been heard of."
</a>

<br><br><a name="n5"> [5] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County.
