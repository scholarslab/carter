<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants Alderman [Micajah] Perry &amp; Company, August 4, 1731, reporting the arrival of the London ship <i>Thistle
</i> and writing of the confusion that the new tobacco inspection law is causing. He also notes that the executors of merchant Joh Falconar are pressing for payment of money due the estate from that of Mann Page, and hoping that Perry will make the payment, charging it to the Page estate account.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] The tobacco inspection act of  1730 was introduced and steered through the legislature by Lieutenant Governor Sir William Gooch. " The "bill called for the inspection and bonding at public warehouses of all tobacco shipped abroad; for the destruction of all unacceptable tobacco; for standardization of the size of hogsheads . . . ; for maintenance of detailed records to prevent smuggling; and for the circulation of warehouse receipts as legal tender in lieu of tobacco iteself. . . ." Gooch also managed to obtain approval of the act in England. It went into effect August 1, 1731.(<a href="Cbibl.html#B27">Billings. <i>et al.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3]John Falconar (1677-1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. He apparently was in  New Jersey and Maryland, 1699-1705. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See <a href="C27g24d.html"target="_wblank">Carter's letter to Falconar 
</a> of July 24 and August 22, 1727, for details about the payment of &pound;200 to him. See <a href="C30d16b.html"target="_wblank">Carter to William Dawkins,
