</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his son-in-law, Mann Page, July 3, 1727, to report that he has met with George Nicholas, husband of his daughter, Elizabeth, to settle accounts due Nicholas from the estate of Elizabeth's first husband, Nathaniel Burwell, for the years 1722 and 1723. (Carter and Page were the administrators of the Burwell estate.) With the assistance of Thomas Edwards, he has decided that Nicholas is due over &pound;367, for which he has drawn bills of exchange which Page must sign. He has sent orders for goods for the estate and the Burwell children. He concludes with affectionate good wishes to Page and his family. In a post script dated July 15th he tells Page that Nicholas also claims part of the  profits of the mill at Carter's Creek for which Carter has not given him an answer.

</a> <br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price.
