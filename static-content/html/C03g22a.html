</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Thomas, Lord Fairfax, concerning the Northern Neck Proprietary which Fairfax would inherit on the death of his mother in 1719. Carter reports that he has been prevented from sending rents rolls and accounts, but will send them soon. Carter states that he is sure that Micajah Perry has reported to Fairfax Carter's opinions about the business of the Proprietary which he believes can best be advanced by someone like himself with connections in the government of the colony.
