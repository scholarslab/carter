</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to the Board of Trade, [<i>post
</i> August 17, 1727], to enclose the minutes (not present) of the recent Council meeting and to report the actions of the Indians on the frontier as well as those of the pirates in North Carolina who were captured, brought to Virginia for trial, sentenced to death, and are soon to be executed. He notes that the Council has prorogued the Assembly until the lieutentant governor, who is expected very soon, can handle more pressing matters.

</i> <br><br><br> <br>My Lords<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to what I had the Honour to write <br>you in my last, I here  enclose  the proceedings of the <br>Council on the 14th: and 15th. of June last which in <br>all probability would have  completed  the Account <br>of my Administration, had not Some new Incidents <br>occasioned my calling another Council on the 17th: <br>instant, the Minutes whereof I hope in a Short time <br>to forward to  your  Lordships. One thing which gave <br>occasion to this Council, is a threatned invasion <br>from the Western Indians. Their pretences at first <br>was to revenge themselves of Some of our  Tributaries  <br>and the  Tuscaroras,  but having met with Some <br>Success in that Enterprize they begin to talk more <br>insolently &amp; to threaten our Frontier Inhabitants <br>but I hope the Measures projected will not only <br> Disappoint  their designs, but remove them further <br> off  from our Frontiers. Another thing which <br>which  has  lately happened here, is the hasty forming <br><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</b> CO5/1320, ff 205, Public Record Office, London.  This is the recipient's copy signed by Carter as is indicated by the use of bold italics. It is endorsed: "Virginia | Lre from Mr. Carter, President | of the Council &amp; Commander in | Chief of Virginia, without Date," and "Received Octor: 9th | Read Decr: 6: } 1727." Marginal summaries of its contents have been added by a clerk in London. As noted in its endorsement, Carter and his clerk forgot to write the date line on this letter; it has been assigned this date on the basis of evidence in the letter and from Carter's diary entries of this period.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Established in 1696 as successor to a similar body, the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations was "an advisory group, subordinate to king and Privy Council, and with no executive, financial, or penalizing powers, the Board of Trade was nevertheless able . . . to exert a far reaching and often determining influence in colonial matters. . . . It prepared the royal instructions for the governors overseas. . . ." ( Henry Hartwell, James Blair, and Edward Chilton. Hunter Dickinson Farish, <i>ed.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] John Vidal's execution would be delayed by Carter, and he would later be pardoned by the King. The new lieutenant governor, William Gooch, would write to the Boarde of Trade on September 21, 1727, "And 'tis my duty now to acquaint y'r Lordships, that the third, John Vidal, an Irishman and a Protestant, whose execution was by a Reprieve from the Preswident before my Arrival . . . was represented to me as a proper Object of the King's Mercy: Upon which I thought fit to take the Advice of the Council, who in their opinion unanimously agreed, that in respect of his Majesty's accession to the Throne, and my first appearance among them, it was very becoming to begin my administration with an Act of Mercy, and therefore they did advise me to grant unto the said John Vidal his Majestys most gracious Pardon, hence it is my Lords, that I hope my compliance will be justified by your Lordships, and approved of by his Majecty."
