</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, July 11, 1732, to assure the merchant that he has pleased Carter by refusing to give Lewis Burwell, then a student at Cambridge, any money and directing him not ever to do so. Carter points out an error in an account, complains of the abysmal state of the tobacco trade, and writes of bills of exchange.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter refers to Lewis Burwell (1711 or 1712-1756), his grandson by Elizabeth Carter Burwell and her first husband, Nathaniel Burwell (1680-1721); Carter was his guardian. He was educated at Eton and  was at Cambridge when Carter wrote. He would inherit considerable property (contrary to Carter's gloomy assertions to Dawkins) and live at "Fairfield," Gloucester County. He would be president of the Council in 1750-1751. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B42">Kneebone <i>et al.

</a><br><br><a name="n6"> [6] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

</a><br><br><a name="n7">[7] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County.
