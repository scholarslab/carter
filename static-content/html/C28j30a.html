<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sent a copy of this letter by the <a href="C28j30a.html#n1"> "Spotswood" 
</a> who sailed hence a few days ago, which I enclosed to <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP1">Col. Page
</a> and desired he would forward  it to you. In that letter is the <a href="C28j30a.html#n2">piece of copper 
</a>received from Dr.  ]Shaw] . I have heard nothing from him since.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="Cbiodir.html#CS"> Carter Frigate 
</a> is safe arrived, but 300 hhds short of her loading, a circumstance which will determine her owners to put an  [end to her?]  going to Virginia. Upon this occasion we shall send the [omission in text]

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have assayed the matter you left me and find it to be copper ore, somewhat stubborn in the fire and not very rich, as affording not an eighth.

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:
</b>
</i>
</b>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Museum and Memorial Library, Fredericksburg, Virginia. This text found in the Minor-Blackford papers is a nineteenth-century copy. Apparently there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- now lost -- from which an unknown copiest recorded some texts. As they are the only ones extant, the punctuation and "corrections"obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. The copist used rows of the letter "x" to indicate material that he did not copy from the letter book. The text above was transcribed from a dictated text made by the editor in March1982 in which he did not note the irrelevant line breaks made by the 19th-century copyist in preparing his copy from the original letter book.

<br><br><a name="n2">[2]  In 1728, Robert Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.
