<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Gale (<i>ante
</i> 1671-1729) was a Whithaven merchant whom Carter would write a number of times times between1720 and 1729. "Like his brothers John was engaged in maritime trade. Operating as John Gale and Company, he was named as the owner of the vessel <i>Clotilda,
</i> built in England in 1726 and registered in Whitehaven in 1727 at 25 tons." The Gale family had many connections with the colonies, especially in Virginia and Maryland.  (Gayle N.Mandell, <a href="http://gale-gaylefamilies.com/john-gayle-the-elder-whitehaven-cumberland.html"target="_wblank">"The Gale/Gayle Families,"
</a> extensive genealogical and historical notes available online.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.
</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] John Tayloe (1687-1747) of Mt. Airy, Richmond County, who served as justice, burgess, colonel of militia, and as a member of the Council after 1732. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B31">Ryland.  <i>Richmond County Virginia. . . . 
</i>  pp. 115-16.

<br><br><a name="n4"> [4] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
