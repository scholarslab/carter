</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company they named Frying Pan to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.

</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] Here Carter seems to mean  "the action of going or flowing out; the opportunity to flow or go out; exit; release; outflow; an instance of this," a conclusion, when he writes "an issue."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online

<br><br><a name="n6">[6]   The only person of the name "Ralph Page" in Carleton's  <i>Genealogy . . .
</i>  was a son of Judith (Carter) and Mann  Page born in 1713 whom, she states, died in infancy. This may not be correct, for a Ralph Page,  a son of "Mann Page" is listed as a student at the College of William and Mary "Supposed to have been at College before 1720." His numerous brothers are also listed. A "Page" without Christian name is listed as a student at Eton in 1728 on page 258 of  <i>The Eton College Register 1698-1752
</i>  (Eton: Spottiswoode, Ballantyne, &amp; Co., 1927) which also lists Mann Page (1691-1730) as a student in 1706-1707. The Eton College archivist emailed the editor October 15, 2015, "we have virtually no records of the school at all from that period, in fact our lists of the boys who were even here do not begin until 1792."
