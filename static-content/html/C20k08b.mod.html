</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, November8, 1720, granson of Micajah and son of Richard, in response to one ofhis. He reminds Perry that he has been a very good customer ofPerry's family's firm for many years and that "my purpose is ratherto Increase It than otherways." He gives some general instructionsabout the handling of his tobacco sales, and comments negatively onrumors in Virginia that British merchants are talking of "new ways tooppress us. that is to make up pay freigt for all our goods &amp;half perCt. for receiving our bills," which he hopes Perry will nottake up. He adds that he hopes a new ship will be found for CaptainBagwell, and concludes by thanking Perry for sending his respects to"my son in the place of Your  father who was his first Friend."
