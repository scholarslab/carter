<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you for the frequent Accounts  <br>
you gave me of the Several Steps the <a href="C29h26e.mod.html#n2">Act of  Parliament 
</a>  took
</i> For <br>
releasing us from the bondage we were under in being prohibited <br>
from putting our Staple Commodity  into such Shapes as we ap<br>
prehended would prove most advantageous to Our Support now  it is  <br>
a law as We reckon ( although  I donot   [<i>sic
</i>]
</i> yet hear any person has the news of its <br>
passing The Royal assent) We have great hopes that our Crops nicely <br>
managed will never fail to return us prizes that we may live by
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will have from all hands the Account  how the Violent and <br>
incessant rains this Summer have damaged our  present  Crops wch <br>
must of necessity be very much Short of what we made last and some <br>
preceeding years all these things raise our Crests to Expect better <br>
markets for the Tobo now gone home than we have met with for some <br>
years past
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my former letter I have already  written  the  needful  I shall <br>
Conclude at  present

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
