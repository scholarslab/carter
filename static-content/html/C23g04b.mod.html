</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Evans, July 4, 1723, an old acquaintance, to acknowledge receipt of goods and to complain strongly that Evans has not sent him accounts of the sales of his tobacco in three years. He sends an invoice for goods, and chides Evans for becoming too involved with merchant William Dawkins who has been feuding with another merchant. He adds in a post script his further complaint about Evans' treatment of him.

</i> <br>July the 4th: <u>1723
</u> <br>Mr Tho Evans --  -- <br> <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your goods this year per the <a href="Cbiodir.html#CS">Carter
</a> and <a href="C23g04b.mod.html#n1">Richardson
</a> <br>I  received   and herein send you a bill of Lading for 4 hogsheads <br>per <a href="C23g04b.mod.html#n2">Graves
</a> I have some more that I intend to put into <br>Richardson that I purpose to Consign to you also  although   <br>your Treatment of me is very surprizing, You have <br>100 hhds. of  tobacco   to Account  to me for, for the  tobacco   --  <br>I have sent you these three Years Successively, you have <br>afforded me never an Account  of Sales,  <S><font color="red">yo
</font>
</S>  and for what  tobacco   <br>you have sold you have not given me the Satisfaction <br>to say what you sold it at, This is a treatment beyond <br>all compare you give me hopes indeed that you doubt <br>not to do as well for me as any body Else and I will <br>hope so  too    until   I find  the Contrary, but I desire you <br>in your thoughts to  put
</i> yourself in my place, and if <br>you were whether such usage would not very much <br>Lower your temper,
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Herein I send a Invoice for some goods, It is <br>a very bulky one but as I cast it up about a hundred <br>pound wll pay for it, about the sending of it in the <br>Invoice itself gives you Directions, You and I <br>have known one another a long time, and our Correspond<br> ence   hitherto  has   been smooth friendly and Accept<br>able it will be none of my fault  if it does not continue so
</i>  only give me leave <br>to tell you that I am Suspicious from a hint of yours <br>that <a href="Cbiodir.html#WD">Mr. Dawkins
</a>  has   been too  much in your Consul<br>tations by his Acquainting you how much of my old <br> tobacco   he had to sell when the Carter arrived that <br> gentleman   and Another great man in the Trade  [he]

</center><br><br>which  feuds   are yet hardly quite  dispersed   but why <br>you should concern your self in them or make their <br>Rule the measure of your proceedings I dont know, <br>indeed <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr. Perry
</a>  has   sold  off   all my old Stock of  tobacco   <br>long since and a great part of my new I hope all of  <br>it before this day I shall not give you further trouble <br>at present but remain   Sir   
</p><br>Your  very

</b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1723 July 4-1724 June 11, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. This draft is the first one in the letter book, and the paper has darkened from exposure to light and from wear; there are some small holes at the foot of the page that obscure some words. The editor thanks E. Lee Shepard of the Society for his assistance in attempting to establish the text at the foot of this page.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and state have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
