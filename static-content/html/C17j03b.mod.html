</center><br><br><i>Source copy consulted: 
</i>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparentlythere was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- nowlost -- from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. Asthey are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. The copistused rows of the letter "x" to indicate material that he did not copyfrom the letter book, and he headed this letter, "Extract of a letterto Micajah &amp; Richard Perry."
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The return address, county, and colony have beenadded for clarity to this unheaded letter.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Richard Perry was a partner with his brother,Micajah, in the great London mercantilefirm of Perry and Lane.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] An unidentified ship's captain.
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Carter's son John was studying law inEngland.
