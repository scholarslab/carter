<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Edward Athawes, February 28, 1732, on behalf of the Frying Pan copper mining company to report the arrival of a ship carrying  goods for the company, and that the miners from Bristol, to whom Lord Fairfax had given a lease, are having no better luck in finding good ore than the company's miners. He responds to criticism about lack of candor in the company's affairs by pointing out that Micajah Perry has been closest to Lord Fairfax, and the company has accordingly used his offices. He reminds Athawes of two shipments of copper ore.

There is a nineteenth-century copy of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The <i>Rebecca 
</i> was probably a London ship; she was of 300 tons, had a crew of 11, and was commanded by Samuel Malbon in 1731-32. ( Adm. 65/195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.

<br><br><a name="n2">[2]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B32">Morton.  <i>Robert Robert Carter of Nomini Hall.

</a> and <a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks. . . .

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Lord Fairfax had given a lease to miners from Bristol to dig on his land. See Carter's <a href="C30e21a.html"target="_wblank">letter to Fairfax
</a>, July 16, 1730. 
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] The clerk probably misunderstood Carter and wrote "Beecher" when "Belcher" was correct. There are several references in letters to Athawes the previous year to Captain Belcher of Athawes' brig <i>Mary.

<br><br><a name="n5"> [5] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] The <i>Thistle
</i> was a London ship commanded by a Captain Reid and owned by merchant James Buchanan. (See  <a href="C31i10a.html"target="_wblank">Carter to Edward Athawes
</a>, 1731 September 10, 1731, and <a href="C31k19a.html"target="_wblank">Carter to James Buchanan
