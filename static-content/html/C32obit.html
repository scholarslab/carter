<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Lies Buried <br>
Robert Carter, Esq., an honorable man, who <br>
exalted his high birth by noble endow-<br>
ments and pure morals. He sustained the <br>
College of William and Mary in the most <br>
trying times, 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was Governor <br>
Speaker of the House, and Treasurer, under <br>
the most serene Princes, William, Anne, <br>
George the 1st and 2nd.  Elected Speaker <br>
by the Public Assembly for six years, and <br>
Governor for more than a year, he equally <br>
upheld the regal dignity and public freedom. <br>
Possessed of ample wealth, honorably ac-<br>
quired, he built and endowed, at his own <br>
expense, this sacred edifice, a lasting <br>
monument of his piety to God. Entertaining-<br>
his friends with kindness, he was <br>
neither a prodigal nor a thrifty host. 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first wife was Judith, daughter of John <br>
Armistead, Esq.; his second, Betty, a <br>
descendant of the noble family of the <br>
Landons, by whom he had many children, <br>
on whose education he expended a consider-<br>
able portion of his property. 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length, full of honors and years, having <br>
discharged all duties of an exemplary <br>
he departed from this world on the <br>
4th day of August, 1732, in the 69th year <br>
of his age. The wretched, the widowed, <br>
and the orphans, bereaved of their comfort, <br>
protector, and father, alike lament his <br>
<a href="C32obit.html#n8">loss.
