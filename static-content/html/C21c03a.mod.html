</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Corotoman,"  the name of his home, on his Virginia correspondence. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br>Although the letter does not bear an addressee's name, it is clear from the text that it is addressed to a family member, and as Mann Page, Carter's son-in-law, suffered from gout, it seems likely that he was the addressee.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] A ferry across the Rappahannock from Lancaster County was located at this Middlesex County property, probably owned by Thomas Machen who appears in the records of Christ Church Parish, Middlesex, in 1725. It was a short distance from Machens across the county to another ferry located at Seatons in Gloucester County on the south bank of the Piankatank River. Carter regularly took this route to Williamsburg. As Mann Page lived in Gloucester County, his servant certainly would have taken this route to go to "Corotoman."
