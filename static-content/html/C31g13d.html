<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter as the representative of the Frying Pan (copper mining) Company writes to Nicholas Nicholas, July 13, 1731, to inform the on-site supervisor of work at the mine that his "articles" of employment require him to perform labor as well as to teach those put under him, and do not permit him to travel about. Carter answers complaints about food and Nicholas's salary.

Nicholas Nicholas,<br>
 

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yo [ur] s of the thirtieth of June I have. You tell a long Story about <br>
your Drivings, which it seems have produced nothing of Ore valuable yet<br>
You give us some hopes off finding better as you sink deeper. You are mistaken <br>
when you think we have not proper <a href="C31g13d.html#n2">Fluxes
</a>. We have as good as any England <br>
Affords. You tell Us, you had some Mixture of Green in the  Botom  of your <br>
<a href="C31g13d.html#n3">Drift
</a>. I have sent an Accot of the provision you carried away with you &amp; <sup><font color="green">was
</i>
</font>
</sup> sent to <br>
you since. You say That the Miners have never been one Day without Meat <br>
sufficient. You tell me a bad Story of Haweis; that he is a discontented, wicked,<br>
cursing, swearing Rascal. I have  writ  to Mr Grayson fully about him to <br>
treat him as a Common Servant by <a href="C31g13d.html#n4">Indenture
</a>, as he &amp; Brunton both are  --  <br>
I <a href="C31g13d.html#n5">admire
</a> Honey should go away with them Fellows, who I have heard a Good <br>
Character of. If you had been Good <a href="C31g13d.html#n6">Husbands
</a> of your Meat, it would not <br>
have been gone so soon. You have had half a dozen Deer for Fresh Pro --  <br>
vision &amp; I believe have had some more before now. You have now  --  <br>
Plenty of Milk. It is admirable you should not be well contented: Good<br>
Milk &amp; <a href="C31g13d.html#n7">Homony
</a> &amp; Milk &amp; Mush, &amp; plenty of it, is what the Greatest Part of <br>
the Country live upon at this time  'a  year, &amp; what you must be satisfied <br>
with  <S><font color="red">when
</font>
</S>  <sup><font color="green"> 'till 
</i>
</font>
</sup> the  Scooner  comes up, which perhaps may be within this <a href="C31g13d.html#n8">Fortnight
</a><br>
I have sent to Mr. Grayson yours Honey's &amp; Whitford's Articles signed by the <br>
<a href="C31g13d.html#n9">Company.
</a> You flatter  yourSelf  that you are not obliged to work: If I understd <br>
Your Articles, you are mistaken. You are not only to work  yourSelf ; but<br>
to use your Endeavour to teach those that We shall think fit to put under <br>
you. You are very urgent for your Wages. When the accot. is made up, I reckon <br>
there will not be Abundance due to you; &amp; although we should fall be= <br>
hind hand with you &amp; be a Quarter's Wages in your Debt, you have no  --  <br>
Reason to be uneasy at it. You will be sure of having your full Due in the<br>
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>
End. You tell me, that for the  Holidayes  &amp; other times tht you  mispend  it is no<br>
more than customary in England. Your Indentures mention no such custom,<br>
nor do I believe there is any such But whatever you &amp; Whitford &amp; Honey may <br>
pretend to, I am sure Burton &amp; Haweis have no such Custom to plead.<br>
They are bound to us by a Common Indenture &amp; are to serve us four years from<br>
their Arrival, &amp; I have ordered Mr Grayson to use thm accordingly. Haweis need <br>
not trouble himself to write to <a href="Cbiodir.html#EA">Mr Athawes;
</a> I shall give him a full character <br>
of him.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the  Scooner  comes I shall remember some Linen for you &amp; a little <br>
Money. I shall conclude with wishing you would make it your utmost <br>
Endeavour to let us get something by your Labour to answer the vast charge <br>
you stand us in; &amp; expect, that, as you are our Servts. upon wages, we <br>
shall be obliged to make you do your Duty, &amp; We shall do all things that <br>
is reasonable on our parts; but, if otherwise, we must take the proper <br>
Measures to compel you to it. It will be best tht both Sides do their parts; you <br>
in letting us have your utmost Labour &amp; Indstry, &amp; we in providing you <br>
what is fit for such Men to have; which I am sure hitherto we have very <br>
 <sup><font color="green">done,
</i>
</font>
</sup>liberally which is all at present from Your Friend &amp; Master<br>
___

</p>

<br>
<br><br>
PS. I observe you write to my Son for a Saddle &amp; Bridle &amp; have  writ  to me for a fine <a href="C31g13d.html#n10">holld
</a> shirt &amp; have <br>
provided yourself with a Horse. I suppose these are preparations for  yor  taking yor Pleasure  abroad. If you<br>
look into your articles I believe you will find no such Liberties reserv'd to you. I do assure you every day you are<br>
from yor business, you shall have so much of your
wages cut  of <br>

 <br><br><a name="n4">[4] An indenture is a contract between two or more parties.

Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.
