</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant, Thomas Evans, May 27, 1721, to report he has received goods Evans had sent on Richardson's ship. He complains about the sales of tobacco that he had shipped to Evans in 1719 and in 1720, noting that many gentlemen in the colony have received at least 11 pence for their tobacco. He hopes Parliament will take action to restore the "Credit of the Nation" [following the South Sea Company scandals] and trade. He is not sure how much tobacco he will ship to Evans this year but expects it will be as much as last year. He concludes by noting a small bill of exchange on Evans to Joseph Belfield.
