</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, December 12, 1727, complaining that he has not been allowed a discount upon the fees for 90 hogsheads sent for sale. He comments on Perry's charges for "Collo: Bolling's commission," for "Mr. Blew the lawyer," and on affairs of the estates of Nathaniel Burwell, Merchants Hundred, and the Lloyds. He concludes that he is pondering what to do with the &pound;1500 bank annuity which he assumes has come to Perry's hands because of the Act of Parliament.

Admitting you are right in saying that the state of <br>my Cash in your hands at that time (which I can by no means agree to) <br>was too low yet seeing the circumstances of my Affairs  hath  been <br>larger both before &amp; since than the calls of my Occasions a much lon-<br>ger time than the  disburstments  yo: were out of pocket for me I can <br>not in my way of reasoning see why I might not have  <S><font color="red"><sup><font color="green">not
