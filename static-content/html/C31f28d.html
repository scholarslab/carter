<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

 <br><br><a name="n1"> [1] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2]The <i>Burwell
</i> was commanded by Captain Constantine Cant and may have been  owned by William Dawkins and Micajah Perry as Carter reported her December 1723 arrival to each of them. ( Adm. 68/194-195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] The Micajah &amp; Philip was a large vessel of some 400 tons carrying a crew of 27. The captain's name varies from record to record as James Bradley or James Bradby. Thomas Jones wrote to his wife, then in England, concerning this ship in 1728, "The Micajah &amp; Philip that comes to James River is as good as the best Ships that Comes hither, but Bradby the master seems to be a little conceited and prodigal." ( Adm. 68/194-196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia
</a>; and   <i>Virginia Magazine of History and Biography.
</i>  26[1918]: 172, abstracting the Jones Papers at the Library of Congress.

</a>

 <br><br><a name="n4">[4] Parliament had passed an act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. John Randolph was sent to England in 1728 as agent for Virginia to try to have the act overturned; his mission was successful, and he was home in the colony by <a href="C29f02a.html"target="_wblank">June 2, 1729
</a>, when Carter wrote to welcome him home. ( Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.
