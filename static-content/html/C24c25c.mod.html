</i> 
</a>
</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, March 25, 1724, reporting the arrival of Captain Holliday's ship, the <i>Carolina,
</i> and noting that the captain is a "brisk driving Man." He adds that he is sending 3 hogsheads of the Lloyd estate tobacco on board Graves who is soon to sail. He turns to Perry's recent sales of his tobacco with which he has not been pleased. He reminds Perry that the merchant should review Carter's correspondence with both Perry's grandfather and himself about John Bashford's case, and then notes what Perry has written about payments to Colonel Cage of the rent for the agency of Northern Neck. A long statement of his position about not paying interest for the &pound;1500 Perry advanced for the purchase of the post of secretary of state of the colony for John Carter follows, in which Carter notes the large balance in his favor regularly on the merchant's books. He concludes by noting that the barber Perry has sent "smells too much of the Camp to prove Good," and by reminding Perry that he continues to need other tradesmen.

</a> is a poor unhappy fellow <br>to be contending so many Years for a small Estate and <br>to be so far from it Still, I request you to give me a <br>clearer and a more direct answer to my last Lettr: <br>I  wrote   to you about this Affair and  <i>that

</a> about <br>it and also of his answers to me which will set you <br>in a clearer light in this Matter  than   you at present <br>Seem to have
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to find you acknowledge yourself <br> obliged   to Virginia that you will be  always    <i>readie
</i>
</i> to Stand <br>up in its Service when there  is

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for <a href="Cbiodir.html#LL"> Lloyd's 
</a> Affair I am sorry it proves so <br> troublesome   to you but you are Strong Enough to stand <br>their  utmost   Shocks I wish you had thought of saying some <br>thing about that Tract of Land belonging to that Estate <br>that I told you I was Sued for by <a href="C24c25c.mod.html#n4">Cary,
</a> There are a great many <br>things I have said to you in relation to that concern that <br>are yet unanswerd
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Subject that brought you <br>to a Smile you had told me my Annuity of 1500 pound would <br>be paid  off   at a certain time and desired me to think of a <br>way to dispose of that money upon which I made you the <br> <S><font color="red">[illegible]

</i> of it at 5 per  cent   I profess I  can't   measure the reason <br>how this come to put you in so merry a humour, You then <br>grow angry that I should Expect Interest for my Money <br>and you should have none for the money you advanced for <br><a href="C24c25c.mod.html#n5">my Sons place
</a> which I shall now Endeavour to set in such <br>a light  that it may come within the reach of Your Comprehen<br>sion and not Appear so  wonderful   a  Parodox  , and this <br>I shall do by going into the Virtue of reflection, If you <br>will please to  overhaul   my Accots: Currt: from your house <br>for many Years past you will find my  balances   --  <br>Seldom less  than   3 Thousand pounds in my favour --  <br>Sometime 4 and I may say Sometimes 5  thousand   and the <br> balance   of the Accot now sent me is about  [omission in text]

</center><br><br> [up]

</i>
</i>move <br>this wonder that you must  allow   me to tell you I Still <br>Expect that  allowance,   make it appear that I had not <br>money in your hands to clean that  tobacco   when it <br>came to you, I will then give up my right and not  until   <br>then, You wrong me Egregiously to charge me with <br>want of Acknowledgement for your respects and <br>kindness to my Son, I am sure I have often said and <br>I believe it is to be Seen in some of my Letters that I <br>took it as a lasting obligation that I should not easiely <br> forget,   And I am sure I have not  failed   to Serve your <br>Interest Since where it has  lain   in my way, I take <br>notice you have a fling at my Darlings but if you <br>would look back you will find yourself to have been <br>the Occasion of Dividing my concern and no body <br>Else, If I have any Darling in the Trade among the <br>London  merchants   it is Mr: Perry and so I  believe   he <br>will Continue to be, If he does not give me new Occa<br>sions of dissatisfaction and I think this Year will Suffi<br>ciently demonstrate it, As for your fresh respects to my <br>Son in Appearing so early his friend as you Mention <br>in your Letter I give you my fresh Acknowledgements

It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
