<br><br><a name="n1">[1] William Hall may have been a resident of Stafford County because that is where John Mercer lived at the time. See Carter's <a href="C29b07b.html"target="_wblank">letter to Mercer

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Pohick Creek is located in today's Fairfax County and runs northwest to southeast passing just south of the town of Lorton and emptying into Gunston Cove off the Potomac River.

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] John Mercer (1704-1768) emigrated from Ireland where he had been trained as an attorney. "He settled at Marlboroughtown [in then Stafford County] in 1726 as a practicing attorney and at once allowed a facile pen to get him into trouble with the government." He eventually lost his license to practice law, and turned to the land speculation that he had begun as soon as he reached Virginia. "He married first on June 10, 1725 Catherine Mason (June 21, 1707-June 15, 1750) only child of Colonel George Mason (16??-1716) and his second wife Elizabeth Waugh, daughter of the Reverend Mr. John Waugh."(<a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks of Old Prince William
