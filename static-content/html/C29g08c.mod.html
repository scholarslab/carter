<br>July. 8th [1729]<br><br>
Mr John Stark<br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comes by <a href="C29g08c.mod.html#n2"> Captain  Bowman
</a> in the <br>
 Lucia  with a <a href="C29g08c.mod.html#n3">bill of Lading
</a> for 32 hogsheads  of  Tobacco 
</i> on her <br>
By her I  received  your long letter with your several  Accounts  of <br>
Sales and Invoice with the goods  Ordered  You take up a <br>
great deal of room to demonstrate to me the regularity of <br>
your Accounts  and how fair you are in giving me all the Advan:<br>
tages of my money in your hands that I have a right to <br>
but I must profess to you I have so great a cloud upon my <br>
Understanding that I can by no means  discover
</i> the force of your reas<br>
oning the Facts I think are plainly of my side And they carry <br>
a full demonstration with them first you Charge me with all <br>
the <a href="C29g08c.mod.html#n4">duty
</a> and then you discharge  it All
</i> on the Credit side and After <br>
All sell my <a href="C29g08c.mod.html#n5">Tobacco for Export
</a> without allowing me one farthing <br>
of the discounts given to the ready payer and yet raising  your 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2
</i>-
</center><br><br>
Commission upon the Amount of the Credit side which <br>
is  bulked  up to a large sum by the  duties  making your com:<br>
mission  <S><font color="red">be
</font>
</S>  twice as much as it would be if you were to  raise  it <br>
only upon your Export sales And this way I am a great suff<br>
erer and never saw this way  practiced   until  of late years you <br>
 Justify  your self under the method of Other  Merchants  I must <br>
confess you are not the Only Person that makes this the method <br>
of your Accounts  but whether it be right in any of you to  raise  <br>
your Commision upon the whole duty when you bond it and none <br>
of the money is Ever out of your hands  is the question I want Satisfaction in
</i> this is a practice <br>
that  has  been  fallen  upon but of late  years  my  Accounts  for:<br>
merly where my Tobacco was Sold to Export were never troubled <br>
with the  duties  Either of the Debtor or Credit side
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You tell me you do me a great deal of service in <br>
keeping my Tobacco thus long upon  your  Stands I should be <br>
glad to find this good Effect from it but your  Accounts  make <br>
out just the Contrary in all of them your latest sales are <br>
Considerably the lowest thus I shall wait for your Answer to <br>
these Plain facts
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein I send you an Invoice of some goods which <br>
request you  will
</i> send me next year as  Per  Directions I have  desireed  <br>
 Captain  Bowman to bring me in some bottles and have  directed  <br>
him to receive the money from you to Pay for them I request  you  <br>
will let him have it Accordingly
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein send  you  two <a href="C29g08c.mod.html#n6">bills of  Exchange 
</a> drawn on  your self <br>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Stark was a  prominent Glasgow merchant in the sugar trade. He served as as baillie and provost (mayor) from 1725-1727. ( John M'ure.  <i>The History of Glasgow.
</i>  [Glasgow: D. Macvean and J. Wyllie &amp; Co., 1830] pp. 227-228
</a> as seen on Google books; and  "Provosts of Glasgow" at <a href="http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/LordProvostsmessage/Provosts+of+Glasgow.htm"target="_wblank">"Welcome to Glasgow"
</a>.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.
</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3"> [3] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4]  Clearing of goods imported into Britain involved paying the impost,  the duty imposed by Britain on imported tobacco, and obtaining the cocket (for which a fee was charged), a document bearing a cocket or seal issued by the "King's Customs House" that the impost had been paid. (See the definitions of each word in    <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online.
</i> 
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] Because English law allowed an English purchaser of imported tobacco to apply for rebates of the impost, or duty, if the tobacco was exported from the country, Carter expected a discount on the charges on his tobacco sold to English merchants for export. 
</a>

<br><br><a name="n6"> [6] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See  <a href="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm"target="_wblank">"Bill of Exchange"
</a> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.
