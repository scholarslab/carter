</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, December 12, 1727,  to complain of the tobacco prices that Dawkins has quoted because Carter has heard of higher ones paid for indifferent crops, and to enclose first bills of exchange. He notifies Dawkins that he has drawn on him for over &pound;233 payable to Lord Orkney.

</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Peter How was a merchant of Whitehaven (on the Irish sea in northwest England), who, with Richard Kelsick, traded with the Fredericksburg, Virginia, area from the early 18th century. "In 1745, Peter How and Richard Kelsick built a store on the corner of Caroline and Hanover streets (Lot 16). While Kelsick continued to be based on the Northern Neck, How ran the Fredericksburg store, returning to Whitehaven sometime before 1756. The store operation evidently continued, for his ships made the annual voyage into the 1760s. The property was acquired in 1767 by James Ritchie &amp; Co. of Glasgow; but How was back in Spotsylvania in the 1770s pursuing debtors." ( Paula S. Felder.

Debts incurred by the forge and the decline in the tobacco trade may have contributed to his bankruptcy in 1763."
