</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, July 4 and 26, 1723, concerning the estate of John Lloyd, his niece's husband, who had gone to England after her death. Carter, who has been looking after the estate for Lloyd, informs Perry that he will buy the property if a good title can be made. He adds that whoever is to take charge of the property the next year must order goods for the maintenance of the families (slaves). He sends a bill of lading for 33 hogsheads of tobacco from the Lloyd properties, and closes with a note that he will soon draw on Perry for the salaries of the head overseer and the doctor. In a post script dated July 26th, he reports that he has drawn for Richard Meerks' salary and soon will do so for Dr. Belfield's.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
