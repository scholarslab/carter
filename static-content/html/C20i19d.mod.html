</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, September19, 1720, sending condolences on the loss of his son and partner,Richard. He then comments on a good sales report for some of histobacco, expressing hope that the remainder will sell as well. Hereports the very good and plentiful crop of tobacco in the colonyand urges Perryto have Captain Bagwell return as soon as possiblebecause the crop will be ready early. He tells Perry that he has sentcopies of Perry's letters concerning Richard Foote's business toFoote, and notes that his son John promises more economy in hisliving in England which, Carter writes, will be necessary because agood crop will lower prices. He concludes that there are no politicalevents of note worth reporting other than the recent campaign formembers of the Virginia legislature.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity.
</a><br><br>Carter's clerk, having addressed many letters to Micajah andRichard Perry, automatically wrote "Messrs. Perry" into the letterbook when Carter began dictating.
