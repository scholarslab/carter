</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes at length to London merchant Richard Perry(son of Micajah), July 13, 1720, thanking him for his advice abouthandling attacks of gout; Carter will no longer drink claret. Hefinds the prices realized for his tobacco quite acceptable but warnsagain of his concern about selling his tobacco near the end of themarket, and then comments on Perry's complaint of Carter's tobaccohaving "a Smoaky smell," noting that it is necessary to use fires inthe curing houses when there is "funky foggy weather."   He agreeswith Perry that the opening of the "The Spanish Trade as well as theFrench" should make good markets for tobacco, and notes that shipcaptains will be reporting at home the Virginian's expectations ofthe best crop in some years. He is resolving to be more careful inhis tobacco production since he is irritated that Mr. Pratt getsbetter prices for tobacco "that comes from all parts of their Countylow lands as well as high" when his own lands are better. Hecontinues with comments on his bank stock and annuities, and "printedproposals of the South Sea Company &amp; the Bank to the Parliament"which Col. Harrison had when Carter was in Williamsburg. He asks thatPerry "act with  the same prudent regard to my Interest as you Do for Your  own."  And he adds someremarks about his upcoming heavy expenses. He concludes by thankingPerry for "the commendable Character You give me of my Son" whichpleases Carter as the expenses of John's education have been heavyand any more would have left him "at a loss to know how to keep the rest of my family from want."

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Louis Wright has speculated that Mr. Pratt mightbe William Pratt of Gloucester County as there were several Prattsactive in Virginia at this time. In his letter to Micajah and RichardPerry written this same day, RC noted that "Mr. Pratt took care ofthose [letters] for James rivr &amp; York" which makes Wright'sspeculation as good as any. In the close-knit society of his time andclass, RC would certainly have learned what others were receiving fortheir crops, but a definite identification of the irritating Mr.Pratt is not possible.
