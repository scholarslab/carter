<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his old and dear friend London merchant John Pratt, August 8, 1728, to complain mildly about the arragements mechant John Falconar has made in the purchase of silver plate for his daughter, Elizabeth (Carter) Burwell Nicholas. He asks Pratt to have him sent Bristol water as he understands it is good for a "cheerfull clear Temper." Affectionate greetings to another friend and to Pratt conclude the letter.
