</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, September 15, 1727, to inform him that he is unable to handle the sale of the slaves on Pemberton's ship, the <i>Leopard,
</i> because the terms Pemberton has set forth are too rigid. The captain apparently has arranged with John Tayloe to handle the sale. He reports the arrival of the governor and the proclamation of King George II, and that he is assisting Captain Christian of the <i>Rose
</i> in the sale of his cargo of slaves. Captain Denton of  the <i>John and Betty
</i> sold a slave to a man named Killby whom Carter is sure will not be able to pay and he expects Denton to reimburse him.

</a><br><br>Although this letter is headed in the letter book, "Added to Mr. Pemberton's last Letter," it has not been possible to determine which letter Carter meant. The last letter to Pemberton of which the editor has a copy was August 23,  1727, and is marked "per the Carter." According to Carter's diary, the <i>Carter
</i> sailed the next day. Accordingly, this letter must stand alone.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

</a><br><br><a name="n9">[9] John Stark (b. 1685) was a  prominent Glasgow merchant in the sugar trade.  "John Stark, another Revolutioner provost, was born in 1685, the son of a merchant, and was admitted a burgess by right of his father in 1706. He was brought into the magistracy in 1724 as dean of guild and then chosen as provost in 1725. Stark's election as provost was quite unusual, because, while all the provosts from the Union until 1724 had experience of serving as merchant-baillie, he had none. This probably indicates that Stark represented a new force of urban politics which came into the council in 1724. . . . " He served as as baillie and provost (mayor) from 1725-1727.
