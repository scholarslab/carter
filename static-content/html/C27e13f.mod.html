</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants Messrs. Haswell and Brooks, May 13, 1727, to report that he is relatively pleased with their report of sales of his tobacco, and that he is sending 30 more hogsheads divided between two ships. He sends a bill of exchange (not present)  and hopes for a better market because Virginians cannot support their families at the present prices. He concludes that he hopes that the merchants always will sell his tobacco in time to report the sales by the next shipping.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
