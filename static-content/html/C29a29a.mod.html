<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter responds to proposals from Colonel John Tayloe, January 29, 1729, concerning mining operations that Tayloe is undertaking with the suggestion that they meet for discussion because there are practical problems that would have to be worked out.

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your favour of the 24th came to me last night <br>Your subjects are so weighty and require so much depth of thought <br>that I cannot return you an Ultimate answer in so short a time <br>I am too Old and Infirm to begin projects at this time of day the <br>Irons I have already in the fire are so many one half of them <br>burn for want of a vigorous Application and yet there seems to <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be a

necessity upon us to find some Other ways to  employ  our people <br>or else in a few years to become beggars
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to find so many considerable gentlemen <br>are  engaged  in designs of <a href="C29a29a.mod.html#n2">digging Treaure
</a> out of the Earth and <br>do heartily wish them Success in their Undertakings I can't exp=<br>ect to see much good from these beginnings in my day but the ris=<br>ing generation I hope will to the great benefit of  thier  poor Country
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time I am under no inclination to put myself <br>to Charge upon the  enquiries  you are about to make nor am I willing <br>to be a  joint  Undertaker with your Society  until  I am better ac-<br>quainted with the progress you are like to make and in case of <br>Success  believe  should rather entertain thoughts of receiving my <br>proportion at the pits mouth which I have heard Lawyers say as <br>the way or at least to have it  Shipped  Seperately and be under the <br>Liberty of consining it to who I please but I talk of these things <br>under a great deal of ignorance
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are certainly in the right that all the grants tht: <br>have been  passed  by any of the <a href="C29a29a.mod.html#n3">proprietors Agents
</a> one third of all <br>Copper and Iron  Ore  are excepted so that you have as much reason <br>to Expect a demand for the Iron  Ore  which you are Carrying <br>away daily as for the Other but I have given you no troubles <br>hitherto and would be thought rather an  encourager  of these <br>good works than an Obstacle to them
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Scond proposal has really a great deal of <br>te [m] ptation in it the  Ore  is just by one of my  quarters  and I flatter <br>my Self the vein continues into my Land and there is no doubt <br>my conveniences are so large that I might make a Considera=<br>ble Advantage by delivering your  Ore  at the Landing could <br>I be well and faithfully  served  but this must be a work of time <br>not less than thirty for  forty  good Horses would be wanting prop=<br>er Carriages will be very Chargeable and hard to be got I believe <br>yours Come out of England and then proper drivers I doubt <br>will be harder to get that will be  faithful  and diligent

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] There had been interest in mining in Virginia for a long time, and Alexander Spotswood was the leader in developing this industry. He had imported German miners and founded Germanna in 1714, and remained active in the work. Carter and his sons were digging copper, and Edward Athawes reported to Charles Carter on <a href="C28j30a.html"target="_wblank">October 30, 1728
</a>, that he had had ore tested by Peter Shaw whose report he enclosed; "I have assayed the matter you left me and find it to be copper ore, somewhat stubborn in the fire and not very rich, as affording but an eighth. The mettel seems to be exceeding soft and ductile the best properties copper can have. . . . I believe much poorer ore has been worked to advantage." ( The Athawes letter is in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.
