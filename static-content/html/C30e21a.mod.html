<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Thomas, Lord Fairfax, proprietor of the Northern Neck, May 21, 1730, concerning a lease Fairfax has given Bristol merchants, noting that he had encouraged them but told them it would be some time before Fairfax would receive any profits from their venture. He turns to the attempt he and his family are mking to exploit signs of copper, but notes their discouragement. He understands that Fairfax will consult with Michajah Perry about defending the boundaries of the proprietary, and a new lease of it for Carter. The reports of iron mining are not to be relied upon because the cost of transporting the ore is very high. He turns to attacks  in the colony upon the proprietary, noting that there may be action when the Assembly meets soon since there have already been attempts to change the boundaries.

<br>May 21, 1730<br><br>
The Rt.. Honorable<br>
the Lord Fairfax -- 
 
<br>My Lord<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honour you did me in a letter of the 9th of  November <br>last did not reach my hands  until  the 9th of March. in it you are<br> pleased  to acquaint me with the  Lease  you had transacted with some<br> Bristol   Merchants  and to desire me to permit them to work unmolested from<br>whence I conjecture they had given  your  Lordship information of some<br> disturbance  I had  threatened  them with if they have said any thing of<br>this nature to your Lordship  it is  a very wrong charge I was so far<br>from discouraging that I  encouraged  them all I could in their design. One<br>of their partners here  Offered  to compound with me for your Lordship ['s]
</i><br>share to whom I  answered  their Adventures would be  carried  on to so<br>little purpose in my time that I should not concern myself about it any<br>further than to wish them a great deal of success and when I saw your<br>Lordships  lease  which was  shown to  me by <a href="C30e21a.mod.html#n1"> Colonel  Tayloe
</a> one of their part=<br>ners I told him I was glad that your Lordship had made such a<br>favourable step to their design but I believe  it will  be a great While before<br>any benefit by this  lease  will arise to your Lordship the Undertakers<br>have made very little progress yet and have not sent   [<i>sic
</i>]
</i> sent in  [in] 
</i>this Shipp<br> [i]
</i>ng any people  skilled in the Affair to carry on their business and as<br>I am told are under a great deal of discouragements and have sent for<br>home their chief Workman whom they sent in on purpose for this design<br>to give them an Accot of his  discoveries  which have  turned  to very little<br>yet.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my letter to your Lordship of the 24th of June<br>last  among many other things I gave you an Account of this place<br>where the Bristol men are upon and also of another that had some<br> shows  of Copper this other place  lies  high up  Potomac  and far from<br>water <a href="C30e21a.mod.html#n2">some others of my family
</a> with myself have been at considerable<br>charge already to find out what this place will  yield  but to little purpose<br>hitherto in our first searches we met with some veins of ore amounting to<br>some few  tons  which we are now Sending, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --  -- <br>

to make a  trial  of what Value they are but as we went deeper the<br>veins grew less and instead of increasing our hopes we are very doubt=<br> ful  we may  ever  find out any Considerable body of ore Worth our<br>While however we intend to push on our  Trials  a Little further what<br>I tell this Story to your Lordship for is that we are in hopes as your<br> Lordhip   has  gone into a  lease  with the Bristol Men to give encourag=<br>ement to these designs so you will  Please   to come into the same measures<br>with us in favour of our design if ever We Can bring it to Anything
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the latter part of your  Lordship's  letter you Acquaint<br>me that When <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr. Perry
</a>  returned  to  London  you should pursue such<br>Measures in relation to your boundaries as Should Appear most  prope [r]
</i><br>Mr Perry writes to me to the same purpose and as to the renewing of my<br> lease  you had  promised  to do it after his return from the <a href="C30e21a.mod.html#n3">Bath
</a> from whence<br>I have reason to Conclude these matters are effected before  this time
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordship tells me you expected  some proposals abo [u]
</i>t<br>the Iron Works I cannot see how any Advantage can be made to<br> your  Lordship from them Works the ore  lies  near the Surface of the earth<br>they buy it for little or nothing from the Owners of the Land I have been<br>Several times at the place my self they  raise  it with very little  trouble<br>or Charge their great chuarge is in Carting it down about 9 miles to<br>a landing and from thence Water bearing it about 40 more to their<br>furnace now what advantage it will be to  your  Lordship or anybody<br>under you to demand apart   [<i>sic
</i>]
</i> of this ore where  it is   dug  I  can't  con=<br>jecture
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now to acquaint your  Lordship  of a fresh Attack<br>is lately made against <xref to=" http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/#Northern Neck"> your  Grant
</a> who have been the Springs of it<br>I shall not take upon me to Say but there are now grievances sent<br>from the inhabitants of most of the  Counties  within your grant com<br>plaining of the hardships they are under by it and desiring that the<br>King may be  addressed  either to purchase or reassume the Grant that<br>they may be under the same circumstances that the rest of the Country<br> -- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are

What these complaints may be  Worked  up to in our Assembly which  sits<br>down to day I  can't  pretend to tell I have already told  your  Lordship what<br>potent enemies our <a href="C30e21a.mod.html#n4">revenue gentlemen
</a> were against the boundaries<br>&amp;ca. and there's no Doubt to be made but their utmost strength will be<br> employed  in Carrying this Complaint to the highest Pitch their<br>fingers itch to have this grant added to their places and I have rea=<br>son to think that these disturbances have much  encouraged  the inha<br>bitants to be very backward in paying in their rents  although  I am  forced <br>to take them in  tobacco and that not to be sold now for 3   Shillings  per  hundred <br>for I never had so few of the rents receiv'd at this time of year before<br>Since I have been in the business
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my own part in my justification I can say<br>I have made no Alteration in anything relating to the Execution<br>of the Grant nor is anything done but What is Very  justififiable  under <br>it I observe the same measures in all my demands as I have done<br>ever since I was  concerned  and as the  rest  of the agents before me did
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember about the year 1695. (as I think) such<br>a  [hole in leaf]
</i> Struggle was made by greivances to an Assembly  [ag=]
</i><br>ainst the grant and the then house of Burgesses  joined  in a [n]
</i><br>Address to the king, to purchase or reassume, it was  carried  to the<br> Council where it was  Stopped  and went no further <a href="C30e21a.mod.html#n5">Sir Edmund Andros
</a><br>was then our governour. I have thought it necessary to lay these things<br>befor [e]
</i>  your  Lordship that your Lordship may be 'fore  Apprised  and enter<br>upon such measures  your Lordship  may think most proper for your secu=<br>
rity to Extricate yourself and those that are  employed  under you here out<br>of the  said  difficulties I am

From 1661 Bath water was bottled and sold. . . . In the 18th century Bath became a much more genteel and fashionable place. It boomed in size. This was largely due to the efforts of Richard 'Beau' Nash 1674-1762 who was made Master of Ceremonies. Many fine buildings were erected in Bath. . . . A Pump Room was built in 1706. . . .
