</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants Micajah and Richard Perry, July 13, 1720, that he has distributed their  letters which have come in a box via Maryland, and comments on what has been heard of the South Sea "Bubble,"  adding that he must depend on their judgements concerning his annuity and other investments. He informs the  merchants of a bill of exchange for &pound;500 that he has drawn on them for "The part I am to hold in Bagwells Ship." Their recent sales of his tobacco have pleased him, but asks them to avoid "These late Sales" for his tobacco. He hopes that because the French and Spanish markets are now open that tobacco prices will hold and that there are fewer ships from the outports this year and about the usual number from London. The ships are loading to capacity which has depreciated prices in the colony, but which he hopes will not affect those at home. Because the Perrys have written that some of his tobacco was not of the best quality, he resolves "If please God I live I will endeavour to be nicer than Ever I have bin." He turns to his son John, then studying law in London, and John's desire that his father forgive his extravagant living of the past; he believes John's allowance of &pound;200 per year is a generous one. Colonial politics are calm, but Nathaniel Burwell has lost his place in the Assembly.John Bashford visits Carter frequently "to know his Doom," and Carter requests the Perrys to remember his "Debt from Hastewell" and to attempt to recover the money should opportunity arise. He concludes by noting that pirates have been "very bold &amp; rogueish upon our Coast this Year" and comments that he cannot understand why England  does not offer more protection to the merchant fleets.

We have since Accounts  of May Date <br>that advise the Southsea Company had  gotten   an Act of <br>Parliament in their favour and that their stock was then up <br>at 320  Per cent   If This be true You may well compare It to the <br><a href="C20g13m.mod.html#n3"> Mississippi   Company

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Louis Wright has speculated that Mr. Pratt might be William Pratt of Gloucester County as there were several Pratts active in Virginia at this time. Carter writes here that "Mr. Pratt took care of those [letters] for James rivr &amp; York" which makes Wright's speculation as good as any. In the close-knit society of his time andclass, Carter would certainly have learned what others were receiving for their crops, but a definite identification of the irritating Mr. Pratt is not possible.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter refers to the South Sea Company whose stock in June had been worth &pound;1060 for each &pound;100 share; the crash of the "Bubble" was underway even as he wrote. ( Goldwin Smith.  <i>A History of England.

</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] The Compagnie de l'Occident, often called the Mississippi Company, was a speculative company formed in 1717 by John Law, a Scot with an excellent reputation in France as a banker and financier. The firm assumed control of Louisiana from the French government on January 1, 1718, and its stock sold well. But wild speculation ensued, and the company failed in 1720. (  <i>Dictionary of American History,
</i>  III, 421.

</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Britain and France had been allies since the Quadruple Alliance was formed in 1718, and Britain's quarrels with Spain were to end with the Treaty of Madrid, signed in 1721. There would be peace for the remainder of Carter's lifetime.
</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] At a meeting of the Council on April 20, 1720, Lt. Gov. Spotswood and the Council agreed to end a controversy that had lasted for several years, involving questions of the power of appointment in the colony, and the power of the governor vs. that of the Coucil.

</a><br><br><a name="n6">[6] John Bashford (d. 1735) may have had problems, but in 1726, he was to present affaidavits in Northumberland County court to prove his parentage and marriage because "he had fallen heir to an estate in England."

</a><br><br><a name="n7">[7] This was probably Edward Hastewell (d. Jan. 1708/09), a London Quaker merchant who signed on November 23, 1699 -- as did Micajah Perry and John Goodwin -- a memorial, on behalf of themselves and others trading to Virginia, to the Commissioners for Trade and Plantations. In a letter of <a href="C20g13m.html"target="_wblank">July 13, 1720,
</a> to the Perrys, Carter  also referred to Hastewell as one of the owners of the <i>Carter
