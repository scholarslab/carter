<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. "Rappahannock," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
</a>

<br><br>The letter to Cunliffe for which this is a postscript is not extant.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Foster Cunliffe (d. 1767) was a merchant and prominent citizen of Liverpool who worked to expand manufacturing and the capacity of the harbor; he served a number of terms as mayour   He and Richard Gildart undertook "a major reorginization of business with Maryland and Virginia . . . beginning in the early 1720's [they] sent numerous factors to the region." They established stores in which retail goods were sold, purchased the produce of the region, had it ready for loading when ships arrived, and also moved into the sale of slaves. ( James A. Picton, <i>ed.

<br><br>* Captain Loxom commanded  a vessel named the <i> Loyalty
</i> in 1729-1730. James Tarleton commanded a vessel of that name  in 1731.

Survey Report 9727, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. See Carter's letters to John Pemberton <a href="C30d15c.html"target="_wblank">April 15, 1730
</a>, and <a href="C31h04a.html"target="_wblank">August 4, 1731
</a>.) 
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] There  were several vessels with the name <i>Rappahannock
</i>.  One was based in Liverpool and was commanded by a Captain Francis Etheridge in 1725; she was a 90 ton ship with 13 men. Another of which Charles Whate was captain was of 60 tons with 11 men in 1726 and 1727. Carter's letters mention a Captain Hugh Brackhill in 1728-1729, and Captain Loxum in 1732. ( Adm. 68/194, ff.30, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Carter first mentions this vessel in this letter. Other mentions in letters to Cunliff and John Pemberton, both Liverpool merchants, indicate that city probably was the vessel's home port.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Parliament had passed an act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. John Randolph was sent to England in 1728 as agent for Virginia to try to have the act overturned; his mission was successful, and he was home in the colony by <a href="C29f02a.html"target="_wblank">June 2, 1729
</a>, when Carter wrote to welcome him home. ( Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.

<br><br><a name="n5">[6]  To sell at the mast means a sale on board a ship where the  "ship's mainmast [w]as the usual place of assembly for a court hearing, public sale, etc., on board ship. . . . " (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
