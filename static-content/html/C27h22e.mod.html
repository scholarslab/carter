</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his old friend, London merchant John Pratt, August 22, 1727, to tell him that he has worked very hard to see that John Falconar's ship the <i>Marlborough
</i> was fully loaded and that he has shifted most of his business to Falconar from Micajah Perry. He gives Pratt information about the current crop estimates in the colony, and writes that he owes his daughter Elizabeth (Carter) Burwell Nicholas &pound;50 which she wishes to be paid in plate. She will write to Pratt herself asking for his assistance in choosing it. He mentions his grandson Lewis Burwell's many promises of greater attention to his studies in preparation for university, and his own health problems.
