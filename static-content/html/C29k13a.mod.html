<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, November 13, 1729, to notify Perry that he is unable to locate the most recent accounts that Perry had sent for his own and the Burwell estate, and requesting new copies. He adds that his clerk, John Harvey, has recently completed his indenture, and Carter, who does not think much of his honesty, suspects he may  have taken the missing accounts. He orders some goods.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  Carter had a clerk named John Harvey, and there are notes on some of his letters, "Harvey to copy." A John Harvey witnessed his will, and some of its codicils, which is logical if Harvey had written it out for Carter.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter means that Harvey had served out the time of his indenture, and was  free of its obligations.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Rhubarb is "any of several plants belonging to the genus Rheum, of the buckwheat family, as R. officinale, having a medicinal rhizome . . . the rhizome of any medicinal species of this plant, forming a combined cathartic and astringent."  "In England rhubarb became known, at first in a purely medicinal context, in the sixteenth century. . . ." "When taken internally in small doses, rhubarb acts as an astringent tonic to the digestive system, when taken larger doses rhubarb acts as a very mild laxative. The root can be taken internally for the treatment of chronic constipation, diarrhea, liver and gall bladder complaints, hemorrhoids, menstrual problems and skin eruptions due to an accumulation of toxins. . . . Used externally, rhubarb root can be used in the treatment of burns."  ( <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rhubarb"target="_wblank">"Dictionary.com"

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Jesuit's bark is "the bark of various species of the Cinchona tree, from which quinine is procured, formerly ground into powder and taken as a febrifuge [fever reducing agent]"; and  "is the most celebrated specific remedy for all forms of malaria. It is obtained from several species of the genus cinchona . . . that have been discovered at different times and are indigenous in the Western Andes of South America. Formerly the bark itself, prepared in different forms, was used as a drug. . . " (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary
