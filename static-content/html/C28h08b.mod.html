Mr. Wm: Dawkins<br>
 
<br>Sir -- <br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am taking my leave of the <a href="Cbiodir.html#CS"> Carter 
</a> a final on [e]  <br>I almost think Concluding the Owners will never have the patience <br>to undergo any more  losing  Voyages, poor D [ove]  can best tell <br>you the misfortunes he  has  been under him [self and]  of the Gout <br>that kept him Confined to the Ship I think  [ . . . ]  

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>
and the baseness of the Officers he has had under him, worse I  believe  <br>Master was never plagued withall you had better given Young <br>Baggwell &pound;50  than  let him Set his foot into her, they Seem all to <br>be pretty much of a piece. The Boatswain, Seems to be the best among <br>them I think in my Conscience had the Ship been under brisk man=<br>agement and a lively brisk  Driving
</i> leader She would have fared abundance <br>better and her dispatch been a great deal quicker I have a very good <br>Friendship for  Captain  Dove and would Say nothing to his disadvan=<br>tage I esteem him an honest man and that he  has  Exerted his <br>utmost in the Service he is in and yet I cannot but be of Opoinion <br> <S><font color="red">but
</font>
</S>  the Ship too  big  for him, This I do not Say with any design to <br>displace the man. The  <S><font color="red">Stoory
</font>
</S>   report
</i> that has been raised of her  Leakiness  <br>whoever was the author  has  been mightily improved to her disad=<br>vantage and by none more  than  Some of the Masters, who have <br>found their Ends in it here was  Tobacco   Enough in <a href="C28h08b.mod.html#n1">this river
</a> <br>Several hundreds of hogsheads  have  been  carried  to York  [River] , which I am <br>not capable to give a  Reason  for when so good a Ship in the river <br>was ready to Serve them, pray God Send her well home and  [I]  <br>Shall  Endeavor  to be  easy  let what will become of her, for I shall <br>never desire to See her again unless She comes under a better prospect <br>If She be  really  a Sound firm ship could be made an Early one <br>and put under vigorous  management  there might be hopes  <S><font color="red">of her
</font>
</S>  <br> <S><font color="red">doing better
</font>
</S>  but as things have run I can Entertain nothing but <br> discouraging  thoughts and I am Sure my Pocket affords no ne

</font>
</S>  <br> believe  I have Said more  than  is Convenient but Sufferers will take <br>the Liberty to Speak  though I have made but a dull heavy tale of it, being

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
