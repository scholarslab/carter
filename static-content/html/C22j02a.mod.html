</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carter, Robert Carter's oldest son, writes from London on his father's business to inform William Cage, October 2, 1722, concerning bills of exchange sent by Robert Carter that Robert had received from Edmund Jenings; these were replacements for protested bills. Following his orders, he states that he will not give up the new bills until Cage signs discharges to protect Robert Carter and Edmund Jenings, who has given Carter a mortgage to back the bills. He will be glad to wait on Cage before he leaves for Virginia on the 15th or 16th of the month.

</center><br> London  <br>October 2d: 1722<br><br> <br>Sir,<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment after I had  received   those Bills,<br>I gave You the trouble of <a href="C22j02a.mod.html#n1">a Letter
</a> to prevent any de<br>lay in the payment. It was not my fault that I had not<br>the honour of hearing from You before yesterday. As to<br>the Discharge You mention, I ought to think myself guilty<br>of some obscurity in my last Letter, or You somewhat unac-<br>quainted with business of this nature. The Protested Bills<br>were sent to Virginia, but by some misfortune were never<br>delivered to My Father or  Colonel   Jenings; and the  Colonel   might<br>well have refused to send any fresh Bills before the delivery<br>of the other, had he not depended on my Father's honour that<br>it should not turn to his Prejudice. You  may
</i> well think My Father<br>has spared no pains in Your Affairs, since he has  persuaded  <br> Colonel   Jenings to mortgage his land in order to raise these six<br>hundred Pounds, and if You are displeased with the Methods<br>He has made use of for Your Service, You will hardly be able<br>to think of any more proper. I must therefore beg of You, Sir, <br>not to think I trifle with You, if I assure You that I will absolute<br>ly refuse to deliver up these Bills  until   You have obliged Your-<br>self to indemnify  Colonel   Jenings and my Father from those which<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>were protested. I hope You will not take any thing ill that<br>I have said on this Occasion, having only obeyed my Orders<br>from Virginia.
</p> <br>I am, Sir, Your most Obedient<br>Humble Servant<br><br><i><hi rend="bold"><i>JOHN CARTER
