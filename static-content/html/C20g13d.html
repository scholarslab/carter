</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant July 13, 1720, in aletter by the <i>Carter
</i> that he is shipping 60 hogsheads of tobacco onher, and 10 more in the <i>Mercury
</i>; he expects 11 pence per pound or hewill lose money. He reports that all goods came in good order butcoats for his two daughters were not included and should be sent nextseason. He sends an order for more goods, writing "You tell me Youlay out my money wth. as much Caution as If It were Yor. own, This Imust Confess is all I can desire, yett give me leave to Say some ofthem seems to be extraordinary Dear,"   and chides Dawkins about hissuggestion that Carter should follow Mrs. Heath's example in hisspending. "I must cutt my Coat according to my own Cloth and blessGod I am able to Do so well as I Do," he concludes. He pressesDawkins to find employment for Ben Graves, the son of Carter's oldfriend, ship captain Thomas Graves, and then discusses debts dueDawkins from Thomas Cunningham, Patrick Connolly, and Mr. Heath. Headds that he wants Dawkins to give him more information about hissons, then in England at school, and especially about their expenseswhich Carter thinks high and suggests that he may move them to theManchester School. He reports a bill of exchange, drawn on Dawkins,that he has given Edmund Jenings, and that he has had numerous deathsin his slave "familys" which are costing him a great deal to replace.He also chides Dawkins for suggesting that they sell the <i>Carter
</i>pointing out "unless another Ship Supplys her place Yor. businesswill soon droope here." He asks for accounts from the <i>Catherine
</i>, andexpresses the hope that he will make some money from the <i>Carter's
</i>voyage that will offset his losses from "Hastewell's estate."

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] RC's second wife, <a href="Cbiodir.html#EWC">Elizabeth (Landon)Willis,
</a> had died in 1719, and the tombstone probably was tomark her grave at Christ Church.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] When Louis Wright edited this letter for his 1940edition, he speculated that Mrs. Heath might be a Mrs. Samuel Heathof Northumberland County. According to more recent research by AlanSimpson, Mrs. Heath probably was Katherine (Bailey) Heath, daughterof <a href="Cbiodir.html#AB2">Arthur Bailey, Jr.
</a> and granddaughter of <noten="RB2">Robert Bristow.
</a> Bailey and Bristow had been partnersin a London mercantile firm and had owned ships in the Virginiatrade. Carter had lived in the Bailey household in the six years thathe spent at school and would have known Arthur Bailey's wife well. Asan heir to both wealthy men, Mrs. Heath could readily afford theexpensive jewelry of which Dawkins wrote Carter. (<bibln="B12">Wright.  <i>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .
</i>  p.11
</a>; and <a href="Cbibl.html#A3">Simpson. "Robert Carter'sSchooldays." p. 173.)
</a>
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Benjamin and Adam Graves were the sons of CaptainThomas Graves, long a captain of vessels trading to Virginia, and aspecial friend of RC.
</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Patrick Connelly appears on a 1716 list oftitheables in Christ Church Parish, Lancaster County( "Titheables in Lancaster Co., 1716."  <i>William andMary Quarterly.
</i>  1st. ser., 21(1912): 106-112, on p.107
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] RC undoubtedly knew of the Manchester GrammarSchool, in 1720 already over 200 years old. 
</a><br><br><a name="n6">[6] Katherine (Armistead) Hone Beverley married JohnRobinson (1683-1749) about 1701; they lived in Middlesex County. (See the discussion of John Robinson in <a href="Cbibl.html#B39">Rutman andRutman,  <i>A Place in Time: Middlesex. . . .
</i> 
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n7">[7] This was probably Edward Hastewell, a Londonmerchant who signed on November 23, 1699 -- as did <noten="MP">Micajah Perry
</a> and <a href="Cbiodir.html#JG">JohnGoodwin
</a> --  a memorial, on behalf of themselves and otherstrading to Virginia, to the Commissioners for Trade and Plantations.In a letter of July 13, 1720, to the Perrys, RC referred to Hastewellas one of the owners of the <i>Carter.
