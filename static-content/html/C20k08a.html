</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto persons abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Robert Cary (1685-1751) was a London merchant,second of the name, a partner in a firm that was involved in theVirginia tobacco trade for over 100 years.  Carter mentions in hiswillthat he had purchased lands in Richmond, Westmoreland, and KingGeorge counties from Cary.  These lands had belonged to his niece,Elizabeth (Carter) Lloyd, who had inherited them from John Hull, hergrandfather. For other information about Carter's pursuit of theselands, see Carter's letters to John Carter July 13, 1720, and to thePerrys July 14, 1720. (RC's will, and <a href="Cbibl.html#A6"> Price.
