</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Micajah Perry,
</a> November 29, 1723, to send him the papers (not present) concerning the case he has brought before the General Court in Virginia over the proprietors' rights to certain items such as "fines and Felons goods." He asks Perry to get him the opinions of the best lawyers in England, especially those of the Attorney and Solicitor general if possible. He calls on Perry because the proprietors are very slow in responding to him although, in this cae, he thinks they should be very interested since there is money involved.
