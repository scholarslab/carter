<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in his letter to Bradley of <a href="C27e17a.html"target="_wblank">May 17, 1727,
</a> Bradley owned the <i>Welcome,
</i> but little information about Bradley has been located. (There is a listing of the firm of Bradly &amp; Griffin, Merchants, Fenchurch-street, opposite the Mitre Tavern, on page 13 of   <i><xref to="freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~frpayments/KD1740/AB.htm">Kent's Directory 
</a>For the Year 1740 Containing An Alphabetical List of the Names and Places of Abode of the Directors of Companies, Persons in Publick Business, Merchants, and other Eminent Traders in the Cities of London and Westminster, and the Borough of Southwark.
</i>   [London: Printed and Sold by Henry Kent in Finch-Lane, near the Royal Exchange: and by the Booksellers and Pamphlets Shops of London and Westminster, 1740]. p. 39. Online, examined 8/12/2005 and 6/14/2012. 
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] The letter to which Carter refers is not extant.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] The 140 ton <i>Welcome
</i> was owned by London merchant James Bradley to whom Carter would write about her on <xref  to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27e17a.html"> May 17, 1727
</a>. John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1728. ( Adm 68/195, 154r, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4"> [4] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] By the use of the word "promiscuous" Carter appears to mean that the lugs could have been "grouped or massed together without order; mixed and disorderly in composition or character; (with plural noun) of various kinds mixed together." He followed by noting that this was not the case.  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>) 
</a>

<br><br><a name="n6">[6]   "The lowest grade [of tobacco] was known as lugs as early as 1686. . . ." ( Philip A. Bruce.  <i>Economic History of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century: An Inquiry into the Material Condition of the People, Based on Original and Contemporaneous Records.
</i>  [New York: MacMillan and Co., 1896], I:442.
</a>) 
</a>

<br><br><a name="n7"> [7] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See  <a href="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm"target="_wblank">"Bill of Exchange"
</a> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.

<br><br><a name="n8">[8] Lunsford Lomax (1705-1772) had been a resident and a justice in Caroline County.  At the time of Carter's writing, he was a justice of King George County.  In 1746 he would be one of the commissioners to survey the bounds of the Nortrhern Neck proprietary. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B10">McIlwaine.  <i>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .
