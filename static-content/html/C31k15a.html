<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Edward Athawes, November 16, 1731, to summarize the discouraging position that the principals of the Frying Pan mining company find themselves in because the rich vein of ore has run out and there are no new signs. Their miners have proposed sinking new shafts at other places, but they have been made to sink the present shaft deeper. He wonders if the merchant can find some Swedish copper miners.

<br>Novr. 15. 1731<br><br>
Mr. Edward Athawes<br>
 
<br>Sir.<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="C31i10a.html"target="_wblank">My last
</a> to you was by Your  Brigg  Capt Belcher<br>
by whom I sent you 16 Barrels of <a href="C31k15a.html#n1">Copper ore
</a> which we had a great<br>
deal of reason to  beleive  would prove very Valuable I then told you our<br>
vein was quite gone out All Our attempts since have been to no purpose<br>
and our Expectations now are at an absolute Stand we drive<br>
deeper into the Earth and carry our <a href="C31k15a.html#n2">drifts
</a> to all points of the Compass<br>
without the appearance of the least Vein of Ore and our miners<br>
are at an  intire  Loss how to proceed thus the great hopes taken up on<br>
our little success are altogether  Vanisht  and what to do next is the<br>
puzzle I have already said a great deal to you of the Villany of<br>
these miners their idleness and their  unruelyness . In some Conversa -- <br>
tion I have been in I have been advis'd that the best men to be imploy'd<br>
in such an Affair are from  Sweedland  who 'tis said have the greatest<br>
experience in Copper works of any people in the World and that the<br>
Miners there work for very low Wages and in their natures are of a<br>
more ductile  malliable  temper than our Cornish men or any other<br>
English miners but whether you may be able to procure us a  Sweed  or two<br>
properly qualify'd for this Work that will be willing to leave their<br>
own  Countrys  and transport themselves into such a remote part of the<br>
World upon such a design for such low Wages as we are able to give upon<br>
the Small appearance we have of Success may be a great question I<br>
know you will do every thing in your power to serve us in this design
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One year of our Miners time from our Contracts with them is alre<br>
ady run out and the discouragements they meet with it is very<br>
much to be fear'd will <a href="C31k15a.html#n3">pall
</a> their endeavours and make them continue<br>
all the ways they can to idle away their time and get their wages of us 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>
for nothing and the Consequence must be when their time is out<br>
to break up our undertaking unless we can get other men of skill<br>
to persist in the discovery What I want to be satisfy'd in is whether<br>
in any of the English mines where such fair hopes of Ore has app=<br>
eard they fail to meet with a body of Ore in some parts<br>
of the bowels of the Earth adjacent and are forc'd to give up their undertakings<br>
Our Miners are  perswading  us to make new Shafts <sup><font color="green">some distance
</i>
</font>
</sup> from the works<br>
already made some are for trying in one place &amp; some another no two<br>
of them agree in the same Opinion some are for the Northward some<br>
for the Southward &amp; indeed for all Points of the Compass but we<br>
continue resolute hitherto in sinking deeper into the earth in those<br>
Shafts where the veins of the rich Ore were met with the Water<br>
Annoys us Very much which the miners do not at all like this<br>
winter  wether . I hear the Bristol Works are at the same stand &amp;<br>
Under the same discouragements <sup><font color="green">as we
</i>
</font>
</sup> are thus You have this affair<br>
in the best light I can set it
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Now by the <a href="C31k15a.html#n4">Thistle
</a> I send you 11 Barrels of Ore which<br>
by our Assays we hope will prove valuable enough to encourage the<br>
Shipping of it I am for self &amp; Company 

</p>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] By "pall,"  Carter means "to enfeeble or weaken; to daunt, dismay, deprive of strength; to impair or diminish."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
