</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to John Chelton (Chilton), [April 6, 1724], to explain that he cannot issue warrants for surveys  to be made for land on Cub Run. Carter understands that, although Chelton and others had had surveys for land in the  area made in 1714, and had presented them to Thomas Lee, then the proprietors' agent, they and Lee had differed  about the details and "deeds" were not issued. He tells Chelton that he cannot become involved with the dispute with Lee. He would do a disservice to others who have had patents in the area since, and to the proprietors who have had no  rents, were he to issue patents for these lands. He tells Chelton that since he became the agent, he has issued orders to  the surveyors to look for the best lands there for his children, and that John Savage is preparing the survey since John  Coppege's death. He has refused George Mason's application for lands in the area, and will refuse all others until "I am  served." He promises to assist Chelton once his own surveys are completed, and sends Chelton three warrants (not  present), reminding Chelton of the fees due for them.
