<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Evans, July 14,
1720, concerning information Evans has sent him about the Manchester
School which Carter had considered as one to which to transfer his
sons, but he finds the fees much higher than he had understood. He
reports that William Dawkins has written of the good progress that
his sons are making at their present school and that he will leave
them there for the present. He encloses a bill of lading (not
present) for tobacco
and expresses the hope that, with the Spanish and French markets now
being open, his tobacco sales prices will be good. An invoice for
goods is inclosed (not present), he writes, and gives orders for the
shipping.
Another bill of lading (not present) is enclosed for ten hogsheads
on board the
<i>Mercury,
</i> and he reports bills of exchange he
has drawn on Evans to
Robert Tucker and Captain Christall of the <hi
rend="italics">Mercury.

</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.
</a><br>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] RC undoubtedly knew of the Manchester Grammar
School, in 1720 already over 200 years old. 
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] A stiver is "a small coin (originally silver) of
the Low Countries; applied to the nickel piece 
of 5 cents of the Netherlands (one-twentieth of a florin or gulden,
or about a penny English)." 
(  <i>Oxford English
Dictionary
</i> 
</a>)
</a>


<br><br><a name="n3">[3] The <i>Mercury
</i> was a slave
ship owned by Francis Chamberlayne and Francis Sitwell, merchants in
Barbados. See RC's letters to Micajah and Richard Perry, July 27,
1720, and those to Chamberlayne &amp; Sitwell of July 27 and
September 27, 1720, for his reports of his involvement in the sale of
her cargo of slaves.  (<a href="Cbibl.html#B12">Wright.  <i>Letters of
Robert Carter. . . .
</i>  p. 40.
</a>)
</a>


<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Robert Tucker, RC's partner in the sale of the
cargo of slaves from the <i>Mercury,
</i> may have
been Robert Tucker (d. 1722), a merchant and justice of Norfolk
County as one of the letters to Chamberlayne and Sitwell mentions
that Tucker will report concerning the sales of slaves on James
River. ( "Council Proceedings, 1716-1717,"  <i>Virginia
Magazine of History and Biography. 
</i> 4(April 1897): 360-
61
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] The significance of the date at the foot of the
letter is unclear; perhaps it means the date on which the several
copies for sending were prepared from the draft in the letter
book.
