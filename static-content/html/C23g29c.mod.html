</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his old friend, Captain Benjamin Graves, July 29, 1723, whose ship was anchored in one of the colony's rivers, with general news. He states that the news from England confirms the amendment to the tobacco bill in Parliament will  prohibit the importation of stemmed tobacco into England, and suggests that if English merchants could only be adept as Scots in avoiding dutys, they would maintain the trade. He adds that there is wet weather that may, should it continue, help the planters by limiting the crop. He wishes his friend health and success, and hopes he will write when he can. In a post script, he requests Graves bring him in a cauldron of coal on his next voyage.

</a><br><br>It is surprising to find the return address of "Rappahannock" (for the river on which he lived) rather than "Corotoman," (the name of his home) on this letter as he generally used it on letters sent out of the colony. His county and the colony have been added for clarity to the brief heading on the draft.

</a><br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] The trading policies of Scots merchants were of considerable concern to Virginia planters and English  merchants at this time, and the matter came before Parliament in 1723. Vessels sent by Scots were crewed by captains and factors authorized to pay good prices in Virginia which enabled them to  obtain full cargoes. English merchants argued that the only way the Scots could afford to pay such good prices was their ability to avoid paying duties on the tobacco at home. Micajah Perry appeared before Parliament and gave statistics of the duties paid by his firm in earlier years and the far smaller amounts paid in the past several years because his ships could not obtain full cargoes in Virginia.
