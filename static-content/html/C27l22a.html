</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his son-in-law Colonel Mann Page, December 22, 1727, thanking him for his long letter the writing of which must have tired Page who may wish to use a clerk as he does. He was surprised that the English opinions concerning the rights of the proprietors of the Northern Neck to certian fees had yielded rights that Carter had never considered part of the grant. His son Charles has visited Page's settlement and found that it was ready for occupancy. Charles had planned to cross the Shenandoah but the waters were too high. He comments on the governor's position concerning the vacant auditor's place, the bad news concerning his grandson, Lewis Burwell, and that he has directed Micajah Perry to send Burwell to Cambridge in the spring. He concludes that he is sending his daughter all the chocolate nuts he can spare, and hopes that she will have a successful childbirth.

</a><a href="C27l22a.html#n1">[1] There are no extant minutes for Council meetings between March 21, 1727 and the date of this letter which makes it impossible to know to what Carter refers.  (<a href="Cbibl.html#B10">McIlwaine.  <i>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .

</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Carter writes of the English Attorney General's opinion just received in the colony with the colony's attorney general's return from England concerning the rights of the proprietors to certain fees in their lands in the Northern Neck.
</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] "The Shenandoah River is a tributary of the Potomac River, 55.6 miles (89.5 km) long with two forks approximately 100 miles (160 km) long each, in the [present day] U.S. states of Virginia and West Virginia." In Carter's time, explorers were venturing across the river to seek new lands. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenandoah_River"target="_wblank">"Shenandoah River"
</a> in Wikipedia, 8/12/2014.)
</a> <br><br><a name="n5">[5]  "The auditor was unquestionably a royal appointee, and held his commission under the great seal. He was, after 1680, upon the appointment of the auditor-general of the colonies, the deputy of that official. When the auditorship was established, it was stated that only councillors and those who had long resided in the colony were eligible to this office, and it seems that this principle was generally observed. . . . As the name of the office indicates, the auditor examined all the revenue accounts of the colony, except a few purely local ones under the supervision of the treasurer. Among these accounts were those of the royal collectors and naval officers, the quit-rents, the public claims, the fines and forfeitures. He swore to his accounts before the governor and the Council in April and October, and forwarded them through the auditor general to the lords of the treasury. . . . For a few years after the establishment of the office, the auditor received a salary from the Assembly; later, he was paid a salary as a royal official of &pound;100 a year out of the British treasury. His compensation was, however, largely in the form of a fee, which was gradually increased from three to seven and a half per cent of the revenue accounts audited, and amounted to about &pound;400 a year."  ( Percy Scott Flippin.  <i>The Financial Administration of the Colony of Virginia
</i>  [Johns Hopkins Press, 1915.]  38-39.

</a><br><br><a name="n6">[6] Lewis Burwell (1711 or 1712-1756), Carter's grandson by Elizabeth Carter Burwell and her first husband, Nathaniel Burwell (1680-1721) for whom Carter was guardian. He was educated at Eton and Cambridge, and inherited considerable property, living at "Fairfield," Gloucester County. He would be president of the Council in 1750-1751.

</a><br><br><a name="n7">[7] Carter probably refers to the widow of John Wormeley.
</a><br><br><a name="n8">[8] The transcription of this word is questionable, and it seems likely Carter dictated a word unfamiliar to the clerk. No other possible word has been discovered, however. Carter may refer to the impending birth of Judith (Carter) Page's last child, a daughter who apparently died soon after her birth in 1728.
