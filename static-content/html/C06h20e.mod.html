</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to an Unidentified Recipient, probably a British merchant, August 20, 1706, informing the merchant that since he has declined to take on any business of Ralph Wormeley's estate, it has been sent to others. Carter adds that he and Gawin Corbin drew a bill of exchange on the merchant for some of the estate's quit rents, and that he will write later with instructions about the balance of the estate's funds in the merchant's hands.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The return address,county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded, undated letter.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">2[] Carter often referred to in their youth as his "Cozns." or as the "Orphans"  Ralph Wormeley (<i>ca.
</i> 1681-1714), Ralph Wormeley's (d.1701) oldest son; and John Wormeley (1689-1727) because their parents were his brother-and sister-in-law. He was one of the boys' trustees under their father's will.
