</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant John Burridge, May 27, 1721, reporting the arrival of some goods Burridge had shipped via Bristol, and informing Burridge that he has hired a small London ship on which he will send a "good parcell" of tobacco. He has done this because Captain Cortenay has not arrived. There are so many ships in the colony, he notes, that he believes some will not obtain cargoes. He concludes with a compliant about the threats from the numerous pirates and that the trade receives little protection.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony  have been added for clarity.
