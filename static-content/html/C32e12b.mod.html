</a>
</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, May 12, 1732, reporting that he has received a number of letters and accounts. He is reasonably pleased with most tobacco sales, but complains about the price received for tobacco from Rippon Hall because it had had the reputation of bringing the very highest prices when Edmund Jenings owned it. There are some minor problems with Dawkins's accounting, and Carter reports tobacco shipments and the general belief in the colony that the year's production will be low.

Beginning in the 1630s the Crown appointed Council members. . . . Crown appointments were lifetime appointments. From 1625, when Virginia became a royal colony, until the outbreak of the American Revolution (1775-1783), the Council members advised the royal governor or his deputy, the lieutenant governor, on all executive matters. The Council and the governor together constituted the highest court in the colony, known initially as the Quarter Court and later as the General Court. The Council members also served as members of the General Assembly; from the first meeting of the assembly in 1619 until 1643 the governor, Council members, and burgesses all met in unicameral session. After 1643 the Council members met separately as the upper House of the General Assembly."

In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price.

</a><br><br><a name="n11"> [11]A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
