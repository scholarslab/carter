</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Captain Loxom commanded  a vessel named the <i> Loyalty
</i>in 1729-1730. (Survey Report 9727, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. See also Carter's letter to John Pemberton 1731 August 4.)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] There  were several vessels with the name <i>Rappahannock
</i>.  Carter's letters mention a Captain Hugh Brackhill in 1728-1729, and Captain Loxum in 1733. ( Adm. 68/194, ff.30, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.

</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3]  The recever was an officer appointed to serve under the authority of the Receiver-General of the colony to collect "the export duty of two shillings per hogshead on tobacco, the one penny per pound on tobacco exported from Virginia . . . ."  (Percy Scott Flippin.  <i>The Financial Administration of the Colony of Virginia
</i>  [Johns Hopkins Press, 1915.] 41-42.

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] The <i>John &amp; Betty
</i> was a Liverpool ship owned by merchant John Pemberton; she often carried slaves into the colony. In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain William Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729.
