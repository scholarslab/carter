He adds that even with the goodssent this year, Goodwin remains in debt to Ralph about 90 pounds andthat "I order &amp; now desire you to" give the sons "the ballance ofthe aforesd account to the Credit of their next account, Current " Heconcludes that Goodwin ought to make good the fees incurred by Ralphon the protested bill.
