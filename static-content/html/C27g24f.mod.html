</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to William Robertson, the clerk of the Council, July 24, 1727, concerning the governor of North Carolina's letter about prisoners accused of piracy held in that colony, and the necessary preparations for their trial which is to be held in Williamsburg on August 15, 1727. He notes that it may be necessary to hold a Council about that August date to prorogue the Assembly unless the governor has arrived.

</i> <br><br>July the 24th 1727<br><br>Wm Robertson<br> <br>Sr -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  pascket  from the <a href="C27g24f.mod.html#n1"> Governor 
</a> of North Carolina <br>and yours came to me last night a little before 10 of the Clock, Your guess <br>at the Contents is so right that I Almost  believe  you had the per -- <br>usal of the Examinations and Depositions if not of the Governors <br>Letter, I take it to be your Opinion by your proceeding that this is un<br>doutedley an Act of Piracy and must be  Tried  as Such, and In<br>deed upon  <S><font color="red">perusal
</font>
</S>   reading of
</i>  the evidences I cannot See how it can be In<br>terpreted  <S><font color="red">to be a less Crime
</font>
</S>   Otherwise
</i> Accordingly I have filled up and Signed <br>the Warrants I thought it proper to give time Enough, therefore have <br>Appointed the 15th of next month for holding the Court, As for <br>the Summons to the Judges I am in some doubt whether there is a <br>Necessity for my Signing them, if there be you must have them <br> written  and Sent to me by an Express for I would have notice go to all <br>that are Appointed Judges in this Country, to Summon the  Governor  <br>of Carolina or any residing there I can by no means think proper
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I write to the  Governor  desiring the Assistance <br>of his Authority to the Marshall for the Secure conveying the prisoners <br>into this Government also for obliging the Evidences to Attend at the <br>Tryal, The Latter is his own proposal and there is no doubt he will <br>take care of a proper Guard also which Seems to me a better way <br> than  to Send our men thither
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Small part of the Reason of Setting the Court to <br>so long a Day is that about that time it will be necessary to have a <br>Council for  Prorogueing  the Assembly If the Governour does not <br>arrive before. I send you a Copy of  Sir  Richards Letter and as Soon as <br>I can get  the
</i> Depositions &amp; Examinations  written  out will Send them -- <br>also pray take care that nothing is wanted that is proper for me <br>to do I am 
</p><br>Your most humble Servt -- <hr><center><h3>NOTES
