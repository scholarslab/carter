</center><br> Council Chamber,  [Williamsburg, Virginia]
</i> <br>October the 24th<br>1707 <br>To the Queen's most Excellent Majesty <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Your Majesty's most dutiful and Loyal Subjects The President and Council of Your <br>Majesty's Colony and Dominion of Virginia, being deeply Sensible of the great blessings attending <br>the Long desired Union of England and Scotland, now by Your  Majesties   wise Counsels and Royal endeavors <br>brought to a happy Conclusion, the Religion, Peace, Trade and safety of Your Subjects of both Kingdoms <br>being thereby not only secured at present, but likewise the apparent dangers of which History and experience <br>presented us with a dismal prospect (if those Kingdoms should have fallen again under separate Soveraigns <br>and interests) being most effectually prevented for the future: Humbly beg Leave upon occasion of this so <br>universal Joy to offer up our most hearty Congratulations, and withal to assure Your Sacred Majesty that <br>as we are particularly sensible of Your Majesty's favour and Goodness to Your Plantation Subjects in <br>enlarging their Trade and Navigation to all the Ports of Great Brittain, we shal reckon it our interest <br>as well as our Duty, forgetting all National Differences and Divisions heartily to unite in Love to one <br>another, and in gratitude to Your Sacred Majesty, the  chief  Author under God of this and the other <br>Signal Blessings all Your Subjects partake of, under Your Majties most prosperous Reign, for the long <br>continuance whereof we heartily pray.

It was enclosed in a letter, November 6, 1707, from E[dmund] Jenings, the president of the Council, to "My Lord" [the Earl of Sunderland] which is also at the Society. 
</a><br><br>"On 1 May 1707 England and Scotland (since 1603 a union of crowns) became the 'United Kingdom of GREAT BRITAIN'. The new united kingdom was to be represented by a 'union' flag and governed by a British parliament at Westminster and a shared head of state (with the contentious issue of monarchical succession now settled in favour of the protestant house of Hanover)."
