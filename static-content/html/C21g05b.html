</a>

</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "Coppy" of a power of attorney from Thomas Lord Fairfax and William Cage to Robert Carter, July 5, 1721, gives Carter the authority to act for Fairfax and Cage to administer the Northern Neck proprietary with virtually unlimited powers including the right to grant lands in their names, and particularly, to collect debts due them from Edmund Jenings. The lengthy document states the chain of title of ownership of the proprietary to Fairfax and Cage (as executor of Lady Catherine Fairfax), and thus their right to grant power of attorney. It refcers to an indenture dated June 27, 1720, in which they had "lett" the propriety to Carter for a term of six years "for the Consideration therein mentioned."

</a><br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Catherine Culpeper, widow of the fifth Lord Fairfax (d. 1710); from her father, the 2nd Lord Culpeper, she had inherited about 1689 his five-sixths interest in the Northern Neck Proprietary in Virginia. Lord Fairfax consulted Micajah Perry about the affairs of the Propietary, and Perry had recommended Robert Carter to be the Virginia agent in 1702. He held the post until 1710 when Lady Fairfax transferred the agency to Edmund Jenings with Thomas Lee as the deputy agent. When she died in 1719, she bequeathed her Virginia property to her son Tom, but she made Wiliam Cage and Edward Filmer, trustees of the proprietary. Filmer soon died, and Cage, a kinsman of the 6th Lord Fairfax, became the sole trustee. From his grandmother, Margaret Lady Culpeper, the 6th Lord Fairfax inherited the other one-sixth of the Proprietary. Cage consulted Perry, and Robert Carter was again made agent in 1721, holding the post until his death ten years later.

</a><br><br><br><a name="n5">[5] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n6">[6] An escheat is the reversion of land to the lord of the manor, or in this case,to the proprietors of the Northern Neck, because of the death without heirs of the holder of the lands.Anyone wishing to patent escheated lands had to pay a fee to Carter as the agent of the proprietors.

Law) A personal chattel which had caused the death of a person, and for that reason was given to God, that is, forfeited to the crown, to be applied to pious uses, and distributed in alms by the high almoner. Thus, if a cart ran over a man and killed him, it was forfeited as a deodand." ( "The Free Dictionary." http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Deodand. 8/9/2006.
