</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, September 30, 1723, to notify the merchant of six bills of exchange he is sending. He continues with a discussion of land that he has wished to buy for many years from Robert Cary of London. He reminds Perry that this Hull property had formerly belonged to his deceased niece, and that the dispute over the ownership had been appealed to the Virginia Council where Carter lost. He had then negotiated with Cary through his son John (when John was studying law in London) but Cary wanted &pound;2,000 which Carter thought too much. He understands from John that Cary might be willing to sell lfor &pound;1,000. If so, he instructs Perry to buy the property if Cary can give him a clear title.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1"> [1] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
