</sup> <br><br>[October 7th 1718] <br><br> <br>Dear sir,<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sight of your man <br>did not a little surprise me -- <br>Had heard of my <a href="C18j07a.html#n1">daughter
</a> being <br>taken ill at her uncle <a href="Cbiodir.html#HA">Armistead's
</a> <br>before. I pray God, you are not <br>mistaken in the conquest of her <br>distemper. Were it not for these <br>difficult rivers, I would imme=<br>=diately come and see her. The <br> calamitys  upon my family ever since<br>I saw you have made it impossible <br>for my <a href="Cbiodir.html#EWC">wife
</a> to pay her respects to <br> York River ; and she's at this time so <br><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you for the offer of your <br>chariot. God willing I intend <br>to be at <a href="C18j07a.html#n3">Rosegill

</center><br><br><i>Source copy consulted: 
</i>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparentlythere was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- nowlost -- from which the unknown copyist recorded these texts. Asthey are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"obviously supplied by the copyist have been retained.
</a><br><br> The nineteenth-century copyist wrote at the head of thisletter:  "[Letter without address but meant for his son-in-law MannPage of 'Rosewell.' It is also without date but appears in the letter-bookbetween a letter dated Octor: 7th 1718 and the 16th of the samemonth.]"  
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence. The returnaddress, county, and state have beenadded for clarity to this unheaded letter.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Judith Carter (1695-c. 1750) was RC's fifth child "and the last by  his wife, Judith Armistead, [and] was also namedJudith following the first Judith who died in infancy. . . . She wasthe grandmother of John Page, Governor of Virginia."  She marriedin 1718 Mann Page of  "Rosewell,"  Gloucester County. (<bibln="B3">Carleton.  <i>A Genealogy. . .  of Robert Carter. . ..

</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3]  "Rosegill"  is the Wormeley home in MiddlesexCounty; it lies between Rosegill Lake and Urbanna Creek, slightly upthe Rappahannock from  "Corotoman."  The nineteenth-centurycopyist-editor added in a note,  "When Mr. Carter went toWilliamsburg he crost the Rapph at Rosegill &amp; went thence toRosewll, &amp; thence by land." 
</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] This word was added in brackets by the nineteenth-century copyist.
