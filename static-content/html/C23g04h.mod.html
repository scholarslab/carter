</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
</a><br><br>The numeral "2" appearing after Stark's name as the addressee of this  letter  may mean that two copies were to be prepared.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Stark was a Glasgow merchant.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.
</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Read (Reid) is not referred to as "captain" which means he was an official of Stark's firm on a trading vessel who was empowered to do its business in Virginia. He was aboard the <i>Charles,
</i> a Glasgow ship that probably was owned by Stark. Carter specifically refers to "the Charles of Glasgow" in a letter to Stark of September 4, 1723 .
