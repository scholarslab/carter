<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Colonel [Thomas] Lee of Westmoreland County, March 4, 1729, to alert him that he had written a week earlier about militia commissions and to send him condolences on the fire that had destroyed his home. Most of the letter deals with land that Lee wishes to obtain, and attempts to persuade Lee to exclude from his survey a small piece of land that would be useful to Carter and his son.

</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Carter refers to the fire that burned Lee's house on Machodoc River in Westmoreland County on January 29, 1729. The <i>Maryland Gazette
</i>reported that "Col. Thomas Lee's fine House in Virginia was burnt, his Office, barns, and Out-houses: His Plate, Cash (to the Sum of 1000 &pound;) Papers, and every Thing intirely lost. . . ."  (See the  <i>Maryland Gazette
</i> for March 25-April 1, 1729.
</a> for the report of Lee's loss.)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] James Thomas was surveyor of Lancaster County, and after 1727, of Westmoreland County. In 1736, he would be one of the surveyors involved in the work of the commission to determine the bounds of the Northern Neck proprietary. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B8">Brown.  <i>Virginia Baron. . . .

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] Francis (Frank) Awbrey (1690?-1741) was an active land speculator in the area that became Loudoun County, and was one of the first justices when Prince William County was organized in 1731. He was sheriff of that county in 1739. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B10">McIlwaine.  <i>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .

<br><br><a name="n6"> [6] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<br><br><a name="n8">[8] One of the many meanings of "bate," according to the  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online,
</i>  is " to decrease in amount, weight, estimation." 
</a>

<br><br><a name="n9">[9] While Carter's clerk wrote "receptall," the editor suspects that Carter may have dictated "receptacle."
