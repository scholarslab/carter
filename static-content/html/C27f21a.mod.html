</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to John Randolph, June 21, 1727, attorney general of the colony, to obtain his legal advice concerning the demand of the governor of Maryland that a Virginia citizen, Richard Thacker, who had been robbed by Maryland men at a house in King William County, Virginia, appear before the Maryland governor. Carter notes that the governor has not written to Carter (then acting governor of Virginia) to have the accused persons arrested and brought before a Virginia court to determine the facts. He has decided to refer the matter to Randolph before taking any action.
