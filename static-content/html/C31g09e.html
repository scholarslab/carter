<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity. The first page of this draft has considered considerable water damage making much of it very difficult to read .

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Ramsay's name is too common for him to have been identified although he certzainly a Scot, probably of Edinburgh.

<br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See  <a href="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm"target="_wblank">"Bill of Exchange"
</a> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Vizt. is the abbreviation for the Latin word "videlicet";  it means "that is to say; namely; to wit: used to introduce an amplification, or more precise or explicit explanation, of a previous statement or word." (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary
</i>  online.

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] The <i>Bailey
</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members.

</a> A letter of Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10 refers to "your ship Bailey.")
