</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, December 12, 1727, to comment on the merchant's letter about the actions of the Board of Trade concerning the Northern Neck proprietary and complain that Lord Fairfax shows little interest in defending his property. He adds comments about the Lloyd estate, and William Dawkins' ship, the <i>Carter
</i> (in which he owns an interest), and in closing reminds Perry that he has never received any payment for his administration of the Lloyd estate since the time of the merchant's grandfather.

</a> yo: have at last got the Attorney's &amp; Solicitor Generals opinion <br>upon the <a href="C27l12f.html#n2">Northern Neck Affair
</a> differing in some points from their <br>former Opinions, which <a href="Cbiodir.html#JC">Mr Clayton
</a> tells yo: proceeded from the different <br>Stating of the question; &amp; that the Lds have sent in their Opinions to-<br>gether with their instructions to the <a href="Cbiodir.html#WG">Govr:
</a> I shall only Observe that <br>Mr Clayton  hath  all along been a strenuous enemy in this Affair <br>&amp; I am apt to think  hath  strongly pursued it in prevailing upon the <br>Lawyers to Alter their Opinions as for the state of the Case I am sure <br>they had it rightly before, The Grant &amp; all the words of it relating to <br>the  Controversie  were nakedly laid before them But if the Proprs <br>will  set  still &amp; suffer their rights to be determined from them with<br>out ever  strugling  in defence of them they must not lay the fault on <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2
