</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his new head overseer, John Johnson, June 22, 1721, to give him his initial instructions as he assumes his position. Carter directs Johnson to inspect the several farms now under his supervision, get the crops planted and the wheat harvested when it is ready, keep the overseers at work on their farms, and particularly to check on the arms Carter has provided. He is to send Carter an account of all the stock on the various farms as soon as possible and to write to Carter frequently with information and his needs. Captain Thomas Hooper will assist Johnson in writing (Johnson was illiterate) and in other ways. Dr. Thomas Turner administers to the slaves, and is to be called immediately when needed. Johnson is to keep accounts of all supplies that he issues.

</a><br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Nathaniel Hedgeman had settled his family at "Accokeek" on Potomac Creek in 1707, having purchased it from "the first George Mason."  He had been Carter's chief overseer in the falls area, but had died recently apparently in an accident. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks. . . .

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] "Carabine" is an alternative spelling of  "carbine" which the  <i>Oxford English Dictionary
</i>  defines as "a kind of fire-arm, shorter than the musket, used by the cavalry and other troops."
</a><br><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Louis Wright wrote that Thomas Turner was, "a physician and landowner in King George County." There was a prominent Thomas Turner in that county but there is no indication he was a physician. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B12">Wright.  <i>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .
