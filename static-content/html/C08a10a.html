</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Bristow writes from London to Robert Carter, January 10, 1708, informing Carter that he has inherited from his father several properties in Virginia including plantations on Mobjack Bay and Fleets Bay. Nathaniel Burwell and Major Lewis are going to inventory the Mobjack Bay property for him and he enquires if Carter would do  the same for that on Fleets Bay. Bristow's "near relation" Arthur  Bailey (married to Bristow's aunt) is going to manage the Mobjack Bay property, and he requests that Carter hold his power of attorney to act in Virginia; he wishes to know what fee Carter would charge for this service.  Although this draft is marked "not sent," Bristow was to write Carter in 1718 about his Fleets Bay plantation, then under the management of Thomas Booth of York County.
