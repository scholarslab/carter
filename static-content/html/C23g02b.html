</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to an unidentified Virginian in England, July 2, 1723, informing the man that others will send him the details of how Peter Leheup was chosen to be the colony's solicitor rather than his correspondent. Carter praises the new governor, Hugh Drysdale, and reports on two bills recently passed by the Assembly that Drysdale is allowing to be forwarded to England for approval even though some in Virginia have criticized him for exceeding his instructions. One sets a tax, to be paid by the purchaser, on the purchase of newly-imported slaves. The second limits the production of tobacco to 6,000 plants per planter. Carter attempts to persuade his correspondent to use his influence to have the government allow the laws to stand, and offers arguments in support of the laws. He summarizes other actions of the Assembly including John Holloway's election as treasurer.

</a><br><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Peter Leheup, an English Treasury clerk, was Virginia's  and other colonies' agent in England for some years. He was related by marriage to the Prime Minister's brother who was secretary of the Treasury. His influence would be greater near the end of Carter's life.(<a href="Cbibl.html#B22">Price.  <i>Perry of London. . . . 
</i>  pp. 75-77, 80, 83.

</a><br><br><br><a name="n2">[2] The Royal African Company, founded in 1672, grew out of earlier slave-trading companies that had been founded in the middle of the  seventeenth century, and that held monopolies on the English trade in slaves. The trade proved so  profitable that Parliament was lobbied successfully to rescind the monopoly and open the trade to anyone which happened in 1698. Carter anticipates that the company will fight the proposed tax on imported slaves even through it is to be paid by the colonial purchasers, not the importers. He was correct for the law was not allowed to stand due to lobbying against it in England. ( http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/home.html
