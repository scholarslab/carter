<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in his letter to Bradley of <a href="C27e17a.html"target="_wblank">May 17, 1727,
</a> Bradley owned the <i>Welcome,

<br><br><a name="n2">[2]  The 140 ton <i>Welcome
</i> was owned by London merchant James Bradley to whom Carter would write about her on <xref  to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27e17a.html"> May 17, 1727
</a>. John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1728. ( Adm 68/195, 154r, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.

</a>

<br><br><a name="n3"> [3] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] The <i>Forward
</i> was a London ship of 150-200 tons  commanded in 1728-29 by William Loney, and in 1731 by George Buckridge.

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] Parliament had passed an act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. John Randolph would be sent to England in 1728 as agent for Virginia to try to have the act overturned; his mission would be successful, and he was home in the colony by <a href="C29f02a.html"target="_wblank">June 2, 1729
