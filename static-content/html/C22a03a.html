</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to [William Cage], January 3, 1722, trustee of the owner of the Northern Neck proprietary, concerning bills of exchange for &pound;400 poounds from Edmund Jenings which Carter had sent the previous summer, and enclosing a copy of a receipt [not present] from Cage to Thomas Lee for &pound;103 plus. Carter tells Cage that he understands these payments are to be deducted from Jenings' debt to the proprietors which he wishes to have confirmed. He needs answers to questions he has sent previously.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence to persons  abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br>This is the recipient's copy. The address leaf bears: To| Wm. Cage Esqr| To be left with Messsrs. Perry| Merchts.| Via Bristol  OF London,  and is endorsed: Coll Carter Jany the 3rd 1721.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n1"> [1] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
