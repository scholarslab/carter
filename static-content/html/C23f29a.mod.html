</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity. Although the corner of the letter book page bearing the year in which this draft was written has been torn off, the letters preceding and following this draft were written in 1723 and that date is accordingly assigned to this one.
</a><br><br><br>While the name of Mann Page does not appear on the draft, it was written as if by two persons, and because Carter and Page looked after the affairs of Carter's widowed daughter, Elizabeth Burwell, it is likely that Page joined in this letter.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Adam Graves, was a son of Captain Thomas Graves, long a captain of vessels trading to Virginia, and a special friend of Robert Carter's.
