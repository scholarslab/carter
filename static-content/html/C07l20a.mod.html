</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Corbin, December 20, 1707, that Ralph Wormeley's sons have arrived safely in Virginia and that some reports of sales of tobacco belonging to their father's estate will hardly [c] loa[th] them with  Silken Suits." He continues that Virginia has had "melancholy" news through the governor of Bermuda that contradicted earlier news of the fall of Toulon and Marseilles; the news had come to Bermuda on a sloop that had sailed from Portsmouth with a fleet of 130 vessels that was attacked the day after it sailed with the loss of many ships including the Ruby which was carrying the colony's new governor [Robert Hunter].

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The return address, county and colony have been added for clarity on this unheaded letter.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter often referred to in their youth as his "Cozns." Ralph Wormeley (<i>ca.
</i> 1681-1714), Ralph Wormeley's (d.1701) oldest son; and John Wormeley (1689-1727) because their parents were his brother-and sister-in-law. He was one of the boys' trustees under their father's will.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Toulon was unsuccessfully beseiged by the British and their allies in August 1707. 
</a>  <br><br><a name="n3">[3] Robert Hunter (d. 1734) was appointed governor of Virginia in April 1707, probably through the influence of the Earl of Orkney, who was to become governor himself in 1710. Hunter sailed for Virginia in May 1707, and was captured by the French in the attack of which Carter writes; he never came to Virginia, but later served as governor of New York.
