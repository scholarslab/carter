</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity.
</a><br> <br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter refers to the scandal of the value of thestock of the South Sea and other companies which wild speculation haddriven enormously high in June 1720, and whichwas nearly worthless several months later. Many fortunes were madeand lost. Perhaps the most succesful speculator was Sir RobertWalpole who made a fortune, retired, and then was called to save thenation as prime minister, a post he held from 1721 until 1742.( Goldwin Smith.  <i>A History of England.
