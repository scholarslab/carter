</a>
</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, May 17, 1727, to berate him for not allowing discounts for a large quantity of tobacco that was sold to English customers, and threatenting to sever their long association.  He reminds Perry that he  often has large sums of Carter's money in his hands and therefore has no grounds for complaining of Carter's account having none. He complains about Perry's failure to credit Carter with tobacco shipped by John Bolling to several merchants on Carter's account, and alerts Perry that he has been suing merchant Harry Offly for several years for debts. Perry's handling of the accounts for the estate of Nathaniel Burwell, Carter's son-in-law, are not satisfactory. He lists a number of bills of exchange that he has drawn both on his own and on the Burwell accounts. The lengthy letter ends with comments upon the Northern Neck case noting that he will stand the cost of another opinion from the Attorney General since Colonel Cage will not pay for it.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Because English law allowed an English purchaser of imported tobacco to apply for rebates of the impost, or duty, if the tobacco was exported from the country, Carter probably expected a discount on the charges on his tobacco sold to English merchants, or inland sales.

</a><br><br><a name="n6"> [6] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
