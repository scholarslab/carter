</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Daniel McCarty of Westmoreland County,December 18, 1717, concerning McCarty's son's progress in schoolunder Carter's master, noting that the boy has made some progress evenif it is not what his father had hoped for. He gives McCarty hisopinion that "It is not always the best scholars that make the wisest men," and counsels McCarty that it will "neither be just nor prudent in you to make his ineptitude the measure of your benevolence." He continues that he intends to send his sons toEngland for a better education, that "Dick Lee's" master has beengiven a good recommendation by  a merchant, and that sending a boyearly to England is better. He notes that he cannot write himself andwill not include any thoughts about politics except his opinion that"a vigorous, judicious, honest Assembly" is needed, and that hewishes they lived closer so that they could talk more often. Heconcludes that he has been glad to hear that McCarty's reputationwith his neighbors is rising, and that he sends respects of his ownfamily and of McCarty's son.

</center><br><br>Your son  has   been three times through<br>his Grammar and I can'tbelieve <br>but some of it sticks tohim. He <br>came here under the character of <br>not being veryhappy in his learn<br>=ing. He hadmade little progress <br>at <a href="C17l18a.mod.html#n2">Mr. Lee's

</center><br><br><i>Source copy consulted: 
</i>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparentlythere was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- nowlost -- from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. Asthey are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. 
</a><br><br>The copyist wrote a note before copying the text of theletter: "[I cannot resist the temptation to copy this characteristicepistle, as it tends to  throw  light on thedownright manner of Mr. Carter. He was wont, it seems by this as wellas by many other letters, to 'call a spade a spade.'"
</a><br><br>"The copying clerk has unfortunately omitted the address &amp;date, but it stands in the Letter Book immediately after one datedDec: 11th 1717 &amp; on on the 18th of the followingFebruary.]"
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have beenadded for clarity to this unheaded letter.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] The Lee referred to cannot be identified. NeitherThomas nor Henry Lee had marriedin 1717, and it seems unlikely that either would have kept a schoolat his home otherwise. Carter mayrefer to the name of the schoolmaster.
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Carter refers to a Latin textbook by William Lilywho is known as  "thegrammarian."  It is  <i>Lilies Rules Construed. Whereunto areAdded Tho. Robinsons Heroclites, the Latine Syntaxis, and Que mihi.Also . . . Rules for the Gender of Nounes,  etc.
