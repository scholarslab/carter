</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, March 25, 1724, concerning a shipment of tobacco on board the <i>Bailey,
</i> some of which he has committed to Micajah Perry and some to Thomas Evans. He devotes considerable space to his displeasure with the <i>Bailey's
</i> captain, Adam Graves, and his slights to Carter who had done some particular favors to ensure the ship's large cargo. He reports that Captain Holliday has arrived bringing Carter's son Charles who is in good health, and adds, "I return you a great deal of thanks for your care and kindness both to him and his brother Since they have been with you." While neither had achieved scholatically quite what Carter has hoped, he believes they have good morals and will  succeed in life. In his own hand he adds to the draft several paragraphs concerning bills of exchange and a promise to comment on his sons' expenses while in England.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

</a><br><br><a name="n6"> [6] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
