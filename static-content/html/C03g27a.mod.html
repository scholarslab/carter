</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Corbin thanking him for letters concerning the sales of tobacco belonging to the estate of Ralph Wormeley and for the good news of the progress of Wormeley's sons, then in England at school. He reports that the ships that have recently arrived need to wait until next season for a good crop of tobacco to fill their holds, but will sail with the fleet as ordered. Corbin's cousin and daughter of Ralph Wormeley, Elizabeth, has married John Lomax, a recent emigrant from England. Finally, he notes that he has recently shipped a small quantity of Wormeley estate tobacco to another merchant because it could not have been sent otherwise.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter often referred to in their youth as his "Cozns." Ralph Wormeley (ca. 1681-1714), Ralph Wormeley's (d.1701) oldest son; and John Wormeley (1689-1727) because their parents were his brother-and sister-in-law. He was one of the boys' trustees under their father's will.
