<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wee  meet with abundance of Difficulties in the<br>
design our hopes and our doubts change almost as often<br>
as the tides so many demonstrable signs as We have met wth<br>
we think Cannot deceive us but that there must be a great<br>
load of valuable ore someWhere if we could fall upon the<br>
right way of Finding it but that we doubt we shall never<br>
do unless we can be provided with men of more skill than any<br>
we have yet met with All the ore that We have yet rais'd which<br>
we dare ship does not amount to above 50 Cask  [<i>sic

will contain about 400 wt each they are about the size of tar<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest kindess you Can do us in this affair<br>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Benjamin Graves was the son of Captain Thomas Graves (d. <i>ante
</i> 1720), long a captain of vessels trading to Virginia, and a special friend of Carter. Benjamin also commanded vessels in the trade, especially the <i>Carter.

</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company called the Frying Pan Company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Horsepen Run joins Broad Run on the northern border of Dulles airport. The company was not successful.
