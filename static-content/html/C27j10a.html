</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Robert Jones, the chief manager of his properties in the northern part of the colony, October 10 and 14, 1727, to give him extensive instructions about the care and control of the slaves on the properties, the use of the horses and oxen, and the need to get the tobacco prized and rolled before bad winter weather. He is insistent that the houses have lofts where corn, beans, and other crops may be stored, and is pleased with the naming of his farms in the area.
