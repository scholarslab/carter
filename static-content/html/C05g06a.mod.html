</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Corbin, 1705 July 6, that he has received several letters from him, and was pleased to learn that there will be a new governor for the colony. He reports that he has drawn a bill of exchange on Corbin  for the purchase of slaves for the estate of Ralph Wormeley,  that he is sending 20 hogsheads of tobacco from the estate's York River farms, and adds a lenthy remark about loading some 90 hogsheads on board the ship the Corbin and that Corbin should consult Micajah Perry for the details. He notes that Francis Lee has written that Ralph Wormeley's sons, then in England at school, have expressed their desire to return to Virginia which their mother favors and that he accedes to her wishes, but would not act without the approval of the other trustees of which Corbin is also one. He concludes by noting that he has received a pipe of wine from Corbin's brother Gawin and that Thomas Corbin should charge the cost to the Wormeley estate and he will settle with the estate which is indebted to him.
