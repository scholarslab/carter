</center><br>  [Stafford County, Virginia]<br> Jan:ry  1: 1714/5                                                  <br>Worthy Sr.  --  -- <br>               <br>                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In obedience to Yor. Commands, Requiring me to give an<br>Accot. of What Quantity of Land I think may be unpatented <br>in the Bodys of <nametype="county">Stafford  and  Richmond Countys;  And what <br>may be Surplus; And how far above the  Seatments  in<br> those Countys the Land is Patented.
</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all which after the Acknowledging my incapacity for theperformance <br>of so Difficult a Task I shall with due Submition Humbly offer my Rude <br>Conceptions asfolloweth -- 
</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First as to what Lands may be unpatented in the Bodys of thoseCountys. <br>I must Confess myself to be too much  [ . . . ]  to Seek in the knowledgeof what Lands --  <br>are already patented in those parts to give any Accot: wth. Certainty of whatLands <br>may yet be unpatented by reason there is Sevll:  large Tracts of Land  particularly in<br>Stafford County which by Comon Report are under patents that as to Bounds Scitu=<br>=ation or place arealtogether unknown to any persons in these parts the Patentees <br>and imediate owners living out ofthis Colony and no certain  Accot. to be given of  -- <br>them: I have Endeavrd.  as far as possible toget what  information I could in <br>this particular both by Enquiry and other means but  cannot find anyCertainty --  <br>in all my proceedings worthy to be laid before yor: View, I have Endeavrd: accord=<br>=ing to my notions of the  Scituation  of the Back or  unihabitted  parts of both <br>Countys to draw a <siccorr="scheme">Scheem [sic]  for yor:  View, but upon my best performance I must <br>acknowledge it to be so imperfect anduncertain, that I can in no way think <br>it worth relying on: It is a Vast Tract of Land Contained wthinthe  limmits  <br>of those Bounds and so Desart &amp; Wild in a great many parts, that I must think<br>no one person so well acquainted therewith as to give any Certain Accot: worthy to <br>be depended on, inrelation to the matter  now before me; besides there is nothing, <br>renders this design more uncertainand Dark then the Charter or Grant Patent <br>Called the <a href="Cbiodir.html#BT">Brent Town

</b> which is Variously Spoaken of by all persons And if <br>Mr. Brents notions (and those in that Interest)are allowable, that Patent will <br>include all the Lands within Six Miles both of Rappa<addresp="editor">[hannock]

</sup> and  Patowmack  Rivers <br>fromthe very Mountains down to the Old patents on  Rappa  and  Patowmack  <br>as low as the Falls of Rappa:  and <nametype="stream">Acquia  on  Patowmack  and consequently leave<br>but a small string of Land on Rappa:  which as much of it, as is of any Vallue<br>is already taken up to within  15 or 16, Miles of the Montains and all on  -- <br> Patowmack  may bereckoned under old Patents almost to the Falls thereof.  -- <br>this with Submition is as much as  myweak Capacity can offer on this Head.
</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall therefore proceed to the Second,
</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is what Surplus Land may be Contain'd in those Landsalready Granted <br>with in those  Limmitts.  -- 
</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here I must likewise Confess my Self as much to Seek to offeranything --  <br>Satisfactory as in the foregoing particular Only this I may presume to Say   <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

As for the  -- <br>Lands in the upper parts of Richmondand Stafford Countys whole patents are --  <br>of late Date  I have less reason to think there may be SurplusLands in them <br>because more Care has been taken in Surveys of Late then in former times. <br>Whichis what I shall presume at this time to Offer on this Head.

</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Richmond County the Land may be said to be all patented andSeated in <br>Sevll  places as  farr  above the Falls of Rappa:  as the Deep Run which <br>goes out ofRappa:  about 12 Miles above the Falls thereof and heads with <br>the South Run of Acquia Creek going outof  Patowmack  River about four <br>Miles above  Patowmack  Creek an inconsiderable  parcell  of -- <br>Barren Land which lyes in small parcells, And here I presume it may <br>be about 18 or 20 Miles across the Neck from the Mouth of the Deep  -- <br>Run  to some part of  Patowmack  River between <nametype="stream">Chappawamsick  and <br>Acquia Creeks, from the Deep Run where there is now two or three -- <br>Settlements going forward, up Rappa  River there is not above 3500 Acres <br>of Land now patented  till  oneComes to the Great Marsh Run which is <br>computed to fall into Rappa  River about thirty  miles above theFalls --  <br>thereof and here on Rappa:  River Colo <a href="Cbiodir.html#PL">Phillip Ludwell
