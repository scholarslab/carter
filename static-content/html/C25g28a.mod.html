</b>  Fairfax Papers, BR 227, folder 32, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California. Printed: <a href="Cbibl.html#B12">Wright.  <i>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .

</a><br><br> This is one of two identical recipient's copies signed by Carter with his large and prominent signature (indicated by the use of bold italics), and sealed with his arms. The conjoined address leaf reads: To | William Cage Esquire of Milgate | in the County of Kent to be left at Mr. Micajah | Perrys Merchant of | London Per the Carter | Frigatt. There is no endorsement on either copy. The text of the second copy varies only in that the word "Copy" appears at the foot of the page. Carter would have had his clerks prepare several copies for his signature, each of which was snet by a different ship to ensure the safe arrival in England of at least one copy.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
