</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his grandson, Lewis Burwell, then in England at school, December 18, 1727, to chide him for an unpleasant letter Burwell had written to his mother, and directing him to write an apologetic letter to his mother. Carter notes that he had opposed his daughter's second marriage, but her new husband "proves a very worthy kind husband to her" and that he and his daughter are reconciled. He informs Burwell that he is to be sent to Cambridge in the spring where he is to keep his expenses low and to study hard. He concludes with family news and his blessing.
