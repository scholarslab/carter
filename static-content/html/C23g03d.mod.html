</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Captain John Hyde &amp; Company, July 3, 1723, to report that a shipment of goods arrived while he was at the Assembly, but he has been so busy since his return that he has not had time to review the goods. Hyde's ship must remain in the colony until the next crop is ready; the last harvest has all been shipped. The Scots ships that came in together have not been able to obtain full cargoes while "our Ships are all got full." He describes the terms of the recent Assemblly's law restraining the quantity of tobacco planted, and states some arguments for the approval of the  law by the government. He encloses a bill of lading for 40 hogsheads of tobacco, an invoice for goods for his children,  and a bill of exchange (none present).

</a><br><br><br><a name="n2">[2] The trading policies of Scots merchants were of considerable concern to Virginia planters and English  merchants at this time, and the matter came before Parliament in 1723. Vessels sent by Scots were crewed by captains and factors authorized to pay good prices in Virginia which enabled them to  obtain full cargoes. English merchants argued that the only way the Scots could afford to pay such good prices was their ability to avoid paying duties on the tobacco at home. Micajah Perry appeared before Parliament and gave statistics of the duties paid by his firm in earlier years and the far smaller amounts paid in the past several years because his ships could not obtain full cargoes in Virginia.
