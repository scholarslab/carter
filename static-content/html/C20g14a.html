<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, July 14,
1720, about his pleasure at the good reports on his sons' progress at
school in England and that he is determined that they should be
raised in the Church of England. He expresses shock at the cost of
their education and that he thinks that he may move them out of the
city to a good but less expensive school, and comments on how little
his education had cost his brother during the six years he spent in
England. He notes what the colonists have learned about the "South
Sea Stock," about Captain Baily Kent's loading of his ship, and
presses Dawkins to find employment for the sons of Captain Adam
Graves. His "Controversy" [law suit] with [Thomas] Wise has nearly
concluded, he has little interest in the "bank" observations Dawkins
has sent, and adds some comments on the estate of "old Hammerton" as
Pinchback Hammerton is going to England to deal with the estate's
problems. Dawkins' debtors in the colony have sent tobacco to him
this year, but Mark Atkins has recently died with no estate of value.
He concludes that he has become a "Great Smoaker," asks Dawkins to
send him yearly a small box of tobacco, and requests his sister-in-
law, Mary Swan's, small debts to Dawkins be paid from his account.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.
</a><br>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Landon Carter (1710-1778) was
Carter's seventh child by his second wife, Elizabeth (Landon) Willis.
Landon would live at "Sabine Hall," Richmond County, and marry three
times, leaving many descendants, some of whom own "Sabine Hall"
today. As an adult, he would keep a very interesting and useful
diary. A reproduction of a portrait of him may be found on the
website of the <xref

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Although RC's clerk wrote "compote" RC probably
dictated "compute" as the word was in use by 1720. Louis Wright
incorrectly transcribed the word as "comport." 
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Carter refers to the scandal of
the value of the stock of the South Sea and other companies which
wild speculation had driven enormously high in June 1720, and which
was nearly worthless several months later. Many fortunes were made
and lost. Perhaps the most succesful speculator was Sir Robert
Walpole who made a fortune, retired, and then was called to save the
nation as prime minister, a post he held from 1721 until 1742.

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Benjamin and Adam (d. 1726) Graves were the sons
of Captain Thomas Graves, long a captain of vessels trading to
Virginia, and a special friend of RC; they also commanded vessels in
the trade. ( Adm. 68/194-196, ff.33r, found in the
microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records
Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library,
University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] RC and  Thomas Wise  had
"traded with each other in tobacco and bills of exchange between 1707
and 1717," but Wise "neglected his duty in returning those bills that
were protested." Carter sued Wise in England to recover his money,
and he won &pound;180. ( Survey Report 10147 describing
C24/1398 part 1, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert H. Small
Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;
</a> and
letter of August 19, 1723, RC to Micajah Perry.)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] Edmund Hamerton (d. 1716) was a "minor trader
along the coast," who "failed; undercapitalized and overindebted, he
seems to have stopped trading by 1710."  Hamerton then turned to
politics and
represented Middlesex in the Assembly in 1715. (<bibl
