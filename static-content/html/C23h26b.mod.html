</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Bristol merchant John King, August 26, 1723, adding to a security copy of an earlier letter (1723 July 25) a further order for nails and agreeing to pay for the freight as he needs the goods so badly. He reports the damage to crops from recent bad weather that will reduce the expected crop to about half of what was expected.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
