</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Bristol merchant, John King, February 14,1721, concerning goods that he has received on Captain Sweet's ship. He likes the cider very much, but chides King because the (slave)shoes he has sent are terrible. He orders new ones that are not to be black because black shoes rot very quickly. He promises to send some tobacco to King but complains that Bristol prices are low and freight rates high, and he reports a bill of exchange he has given toCharles Burgess.
