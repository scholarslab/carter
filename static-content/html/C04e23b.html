</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants Jonathan Mathews and John Goodwin, 1704 May 23, concerning the affairs of the estate of Ralph Wormeley for which he is one of a number of trustees. He notes that a bill of exchange to Dr. John Lomax, husband of Wormeley's daughter Elizabeth, does not appear in the account the merchants have sent, reports the shipment of 32 hogsheads belonging to the estate by two ships, and that he has drawn another bill to Dr. Lomax, adding that "It is the Last he has to Claim On that [estate]."

</i>  Christ Church Parish, Lancaster County, Processioners' Returns, 1711-1783, and Wormeley Estate Papers, 1701-1710, 1716, Acc. 30126, Archives Research Services, Library of Virginia, Richmond, 159. This partially undated letter is written on the same page as another of the date May 23, 1704.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
