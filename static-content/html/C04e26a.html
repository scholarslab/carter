</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter write to London merchant Thomas Corbin that he is sending 10 hogsheads of tobacco with two different marks; some are to be credited to the account of John Wormeley and the remainder to RC's sister-in-law, Elizabeth (Wormeley) Churchill, widow of Ralph Wormeley. He encloses an order for goods, some of which are for the use of Judith Wormeley, unmentioned in her father's will, but whom Wormeley's trustees feel must be supported. He leaves it to Corbin and Edmund Jenings, another trustee, to decide how much should be spent.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
