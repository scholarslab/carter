</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, October 17, 1723, requesting his assistance in obtaining a post on the Council of Virginia for his son John in the place of William Bassett who has just died. He has just returned from a trip up the Rappahannock to the falls on which he found only poor crops. The <i>Harrison
</i> has arrived, and he  has heard guns and assumes others have as well. If all the ships that are expected arrive, freight rates will be lower than what he understands Perry has chartered for.
