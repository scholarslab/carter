</sup> <br>  [<i>post
</i> February 1,] 1727 <br>Sir Richd Everard<br> <br>Sr<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter you did me the favour to write of the 30th of<br>last month has given me an opportunity to remove the fears of<br>the Nottoway Indians, by letting them know the result of your  -- <br>Conference with the  Maherines, And because I am willing to <br>satisfy those Indians as to the conduct of our other Tributaries,<br>of whom they seem to entertain some suspicition, I take this<br>occasion to acquaint you that <a href="Cbiodir.html#NH">Collo Harrison
</a> who has strictly<br>examined and observed <sup><font color="green">on
</i>
</font>
</sup> the actions of our Tributaries while<br>the  Cattabaws  were in their neighbourhood, assures me -- <br>that the old Cuanichee King (by which we suppose is meant<br>the Tattero King) has lived on a plantation of his these<br>five years past, and has little or no correspondence with<br>the  Saponies,  and that he was so far from assisting the<br> Cattabaws , that he was in very great danger of being  -- <br>killed by one of their parties who beset his house from -- <br>whence he very narrowly escaped, and lay concealed in a Swamp<br> untill  Colo Harrison marched out with  <S><font color="red">the
</font>
</S>  <sup><font color="green">a
</i>
</font>
</sup> body of the -- <br>Militia and obliged the  Cattabaws  to return back to their<br>own Country
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Saponies readily  own'd  to Collo Harrison that<br>three of their men contrary to their express orders went<br>with the  Cattabaws  under pretence of guiding them to the<br>Tusiaruros but it seems they afterwards altered their -- <br>Route and only five of them with one of the  Saponies,  <br>went to the Tuscaruroes, the rest of the party marching<br>directly for the  Maherines,  and upon Collo Harrison's -- <br>Orders the Chief men of the  Saponies,   very frankly -- <br>agreed to send in these three fellows bound to <sup><font color="green">his
</i>
</font>
</sup>  <S><font color="red">Collo
</font>
</S>  -- <br> <S><font color="red">Harrison's
</font>
</S>  house, but they being apprehensive they should<br>be delivered up to the  Maherines,  as was indeed intended -- <br>returned no more to the  Saponies,   town, but stayed with the -- <br><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2
</i>-
</center><br><br> Cattabaws  on Roanoke where one of them died, and the other two<br>are gone off with them. Thus you see how little reason there is<br>to make the  Saponies,   accountable for the action of these -- <br>Renegades, who, as they  join'd  the  Cattabaws ">Cattabawas against the<br>will of their nation, are now no longer in their power<br>either to be punished or delivered up by them: I must also<br>in justice to the  Saponies,   inform you that, tho' they think<br>they have had just cause to make war on the  Tuscaruroes <br>for the loss of so many of their men killed by that nation<br>last winter, yet they absolutedly refused to join the  Cattabaws <br>in attacking <a href="C27h19a.html#n3">Blounts Town
</a> as was proposed to them, declaring<br>they would not rest contented with such satisfaction as this -- <br>Government should think fit to obtain of the  Tuscarures <br>rather than transgress the orders they had received from<br>hence, by taking a revenge of their own, and this may<br>serve to convince the  Maherines  of the peaceable  dispositn <br>of the  Saponies,  , and how far that nation has been from -- <br>assisting the <sic corr="Catabaws,"> Cattabaws  [sic]  in the mischief they have -- <br>done.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the  Maherines,  boy taken prisoner Collo Harrison<br>in his Conference with some of the Chiefs of that party<br>who took him insisted on his being restored, and  threatned <br>them with the resentment of this Governmt: in case it<br>were either refused or delayed, but the boy being some time<br>before sent away to the  Cattabaw  Town, all that could<br>be obtain'dwas a promise from the King of the Sagars<br>Indians that as soon as he got home the boy should be<br>sent to Colo Harrisons; so that if any credit is to be -- <br>given to the promise of this Indian King, the Maherines<br>may soon expect the return of this prisoner, if not they<br>will see how ready this Government is to do them good offices<br>even without their application.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This you will be pleased to represent to the  Maherines,  as a<br>proof of our inclination  <S><font color="red">to do ther
</font>
</S>  gratify them in any thing that<br>is reasonable, and I hope they will not insist upon what is<br>otherwise, as is that of their demand of  <S><font color="red">treaties ?
</font>
</S>  satisfaction -- <br><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>3

</a><br><br>The date of the letter is determined by the a record of the receipt of this letter by the North Carolina governor who had it read to the Council of that colony on April 3, 1727, and that Carter wrote in his diary February 1, 1727, "The Council mett late we prorougd the Assembly Went upon the Enquiry of the Murder of the Suppones." A. Christoper Meekins of the State Archives, Office of Archives and Records, North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, wrote the editor April 26, 2004, that the recipent's copy of Carter's letter to Everard apparently has not survived as it cannot be located among the holdings in the Archives.
