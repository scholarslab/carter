</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, August [3-8, 1723],  about a bill of exchange payable to John Bagg he has drawn on the account of his late son-in-law, Nathaniel Burwell, in which his other son-in-law, Mann Page, will join him in signing. He refers to an annuity he has offered the merchant, and notes that if Perry will not accept it, he thinks he will write to soon to direct Perry to use the cash to buy bank stock.

The corner of the letter book page has been torn off after the month, and the dates 3-8 and year 1723 have been supplied as this letter stands in the letterbook between letters dated the 3rd and the 8th in that year.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br>Carter added the closing in his hand  to the clerk's draft as the use of italics indicates.
