</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes August 1, 1721, to  Lord Fairfax, the owner of the Northern Neck proprietary, and William Cage, trustee under Fairfax's mother's will, concerning affairs of the proprietary on which Carter holds a lease. He encloses bills of exchange from Edmund Jenings, the former lease holder, for &pound;400 in partial payment of debts due, and noting that Jenings requests that the bills not be presented for payment for as long as possible. Micajah Perry has been ordered to pay the proprietor's rent for the year 1720, and Carter will plan to pay at the end of each year. He complains about the bad bargain the lease is proving as he has received less than &pound;20 in income so far.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence to persons abroad. The county and colony  have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><br>This is the recipient's copy, signed by Carter, as is shown by the use of italics, and has considerable damage to the body. Endorsed "Coll [. . .]; there is no address.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n1"> [1] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
