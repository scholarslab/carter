<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his grandson Lewis Burwell, a student at Cambridge, August 12, 1731, to chide him for having someone else draft his last letter, and to point out that if Burwell remains at the university for another two years, he will spend nearly all of his inheritance from his father.

Mr. Lewis Burwell<br>
 


<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  received  your letter of the 25th of January from <a href="C31h12a.mod.html#n2"> Caius <br>
 College 
</a> by the difference in the Style  <S><font color="red">[illegible]
</font>
</S> <br>
from all the rest of the Epistles I have had from you I  looked  upon<br>
it as the  <S><font color="red">[illegible]
</font>
</S>  effects of anothers invention and not the product<br>
of your own brain and therefore Shall not run into the particulars<br>
of such a Conceited  piece  of Stuff, it tells me you are under close  applica= <br>
tion after the  Search  of knowledge I pray god send amongst your<br>
great gettings you promise yourself where you are that you may get<br>
Wisdom and such that will be your guide in a Virginia Life<br>
which must be your doom if you do not Fall into Courses that will<br>
threaten your ruin in the end As for Scholarship your head seems<br>
not to be  turned  to make any large improvements that Way what<br>
good the conversation of the University will do you I shall not<br>
prognosticate but I think I may fairly suppose you will come<br>
into your own country very indifferently  equipped  with talents<br>
proper to govern your affairs here.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have broke [n]   through  my orders and it is in vain for<br>
me to lay any more upon you <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr. Perry
</a> tells me that you intend in the<br>
next Shipping you talk of staying two years where you are which<br>
will reduce to A low Ebb the money that you will have to Claim out<br>
of <a href="Cbiodir.html#NB">your fathers
</a> Estate and you will be put to the refuge of living upon<br>
the produce of  Your  crops which you may be  informed  by Mr. Perry<br>
will do very little in these dead times If you are Capable of serious<br>
thoughts the consideration of this  melancholy  cloud over us will<br>
stick close to you and put you upon thinking that money does not<br>
grow out of the tops of Our trees

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

He was educated at Eton and Cambridge, and inherited considerable property, living at "Fairfield," Gloucester County. He would be president of the Council in 1750-1751.

Landon would live at "Sabine Hall," Richmond County, and marry three times, leaving many descendants, some of whom own "Sabine Hall" today. As an adult, he would keep a very interesting and useful diary.
