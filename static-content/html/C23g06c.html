</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to [Edmund Jenings] of York County, July 6, 1723, to remind Jenings of the interest payments now due Carter. He tells Jenings that his neighbor, Philip Smith, will carry the letter to Williamsburg, but knows nothing of the contents. Carter's son, John, will deliver the letter if he should be in town. He also reminds Jenings of sums due to the proprietors, and writes that he cannot wait later than September first for this money.

</a><br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
