</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and state have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Russell would be in 1727 captain of the <i>Portland,
</i> a vessel owned by Edward Tucker of Weymouth. This may be the ketch that Carter refers to in this letter.  ( Survey Report 9729 describing the Weymouth Port Books, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Francis Chamberlayne may have been the wealthy grocer of London whose daughter Elizabeth married John Francis Fauquier, an official of the mint and director of the Bank of England, between 1694 and 1702. Carter had represented Chamberlain and his partner, Francis Sitwell, in the sale of a cargo of slaves in 1720.  ( http://www.geocities.com/markfreemn/francis_fauquier.html
