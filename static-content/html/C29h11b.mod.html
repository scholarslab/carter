<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Stark was a  prominent Glasgow merchant in the sugar trade. He served as as baillie and provost (mayor) from 1725-1727. ( John M'ure.  <i>The History of Glasgow.
</i>  [Glasgow: D. Macvean and J. Wyllie &amp; Co., 1830] pp. 227-228
</a> as seen on Google books; and  "Provosts of Glasgow" at <a href="http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/LordProvostsmessage/Provosts+of+Glasgow.htm"target="_wblank">"Welcome to Glasgow"

</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2]  The <i>Caledon,
</i> commanded by  John Stevenson in 1729, was owned in part by merchant John Zuil. In what British city Zuil lived is not clear, but it may have been Liverpool because city directories of 1767-1773 list a John Zuil as a merchant, first in Cable Street, and later, in King Street. This probably would have been a son of the man Carter knew, given the shorter lives at this period.  (See <a href="C29g22b.html"target="_wblank">Carter to Zuil,
</a> July 22, 1729; "Yuil Family Website," and <a href="http://www.yulefamily.com/newsletters/yule24.htm"target="_wblank">Yule Family Newsletter
</a>, #24 (Fall 1998).

 <br><br><a name="n3"> [3] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4"> [4] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See  <a href="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm"target="_wblank">"Bill of Exchange"
</a> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.
</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."
</a>

 <br><br><a name="n6">[6] Snuff is "a preparation of powdered tobacco for inhaling through the nostrils."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
