</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Captain Thomas Hooper in Stafford County, June 22, 1721,  concerning the affairs of Nathaniel Hedgeman, his chief overseer who had recently been killed. He informs Hooper that he has appointed John Johnson to succeed Hedgeman, and asks Hooper to assist him, and also to assist in settling Hedgeman's accounts. He reminds Hooper that he must make progress in collecting quit rents, and get them to Carter as soon as possible or there will not be time to prize the tobacco, in which most rents are paid, prior to shipping it.
