</a> lost I have <br>Seen the Accots:  Delivered  to him there is one Accot: more you must get <br>ready which is how the Levys have been paid with these Accots and your <br>Assistance if the Doctor and I can find a time to meet at <a href="Cbiodir.html#MPP1">Colonel Pages
</a> <br> we  Shall bring all these little matters to a  Settlement  and so will <br>leave them at present,
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You tell me you had a meeting with Hazlewood &amp; <br>that he will meet me at <a href="C27g15a.mod.html#n2">Town
</a> when I come there I am generally so <br> busy  when I am there that it will be no proper place to make an <br> Agreement  with him at Indeed the properest plase would be to see him <br>at <a href="C27g15a.mod.html#n3">Rippon
</a> but how to Contrive that I dont know as for his doing the <br>work by <a href="C27g15a.mod.html#n4">Squares
</a> it is a way I am not acquainted with I would make <br>a particular  agreement  with him what he is to do and know the Certainty <br>of what I must pay him for it. It is a large  Job  and will be worth <br>his while to  undertake  it at a reasonable rate. I was telling you of <br>another Carpenter that lives near the Town whose name is out of my <br>head I think you told me you knew him that I had a very good <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</a><br><br>The name of Carter's home, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] William Camp was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County. (Carter to George Braxton, 1729 November 20, and Carter to William Dawkins,1732  July 11.   <i>Virginia Tax Records.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Williamsburg
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Rippon Hall had been Edmund Jening's estate in York County which he had acquired in 1687 from John and Unity West when it was named "Poplar Neck." Jenings's bad financial circumstances forced him to mortgage the property to Carter who eventually acquired title to it. ( "Notes and Queries."  <i>William and Mary Quarterly.
</i>  2[Apr. 1894]: 270-278.

</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] The carpenter Hazelwood apparently wished to charge for his work by the square which is a builder's term for the number of shingles or slates required to roof 100 square feet, or a square area of roof ten feet on a side.
