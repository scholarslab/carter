</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to the trustee of the Fairfax estate, William Cage, July 28, 1725, that he has received the statement of the case that he  has brought on behalf of the proprietor before the council of the colony to claim "fines and forfeitures, and the Goods of Felo de ses." He says that deodands are not in contention, and that Cage and Lord Fairfax must now make the case to the Board of Trade to which this case statement will be sent.
