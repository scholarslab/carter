</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] The editor has been unable to determine what Carter meant by the use of the phrase "piece of Dowles."  There is nothing in the  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i>  that is useful unless one stretches the word "Dowles" to mean "dowels."  Unfortunately any further correcpondence about "Dowles" is not extant.
</a> <br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online

Randolph would not leave for England until 1729; his mission would be successful.   ( Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.

Wikipedia, citing a book by Ronald E. Zupco, states that a pipe was half a tun which was "a large vat or vessel, most often holding 252 wine gallons," meaning a pipe was roughly 126 gallons of wine.
