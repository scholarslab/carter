</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, December 27, 1723, reporting the arrival of the <i>Burwell
</i> and that captains Adam Graves and Peter Wills have not yet arrived. The winter has been mild thus far but whether later ships will be able to load and sail early he will not predict. The crop is only about 2/3 of the previous year.
