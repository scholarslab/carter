</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant John Goodwin, July 20,1710, that he must once again take up the affairs of the estate ofRalph Wormeley although the sons are now in charge of their affairs.He reminds Goodwin that in an account current of September 3, 1708,Goodwin had reported that the estate had a balance with him of morethan 182 pounds against which Carter had drawn only one small billfor four pounds to Doctor Lomax. He chastises Goodwin for not havingcredited young Ralph Wormeley with this large balance, and further,for his failure to pay a small bill sent by Ralph forcing Ralph todraw a new bill and pay the fees. He adds that even with the goodssent this year, Goodwin remains in debt to Ralph about 90 pounds andthat "I order &amp; now desire you to" give the sons "the ballance ofthe aforesd account to the Credit of their next account, Currt." Heconcludes that Goodwin ought to make good the fees incurred by Ralphon the protested bill.
