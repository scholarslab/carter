</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Francis Lee that he is shipping 8 hogsheads of tobacco belonging to the estate of Ralph Wormeley, not a good crop but what there is. He notes that Lee must be very careful with the expenses of Wormeley's sons, then in school under Lee's supervision, because the revenues of the estate are poor.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and state have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter often referred to in their youth as his "Cozns." Ralph Wormeley (ca. 1681-1714), Ralph Wormeley's (d.1701) oldest son; and John Wormeley (1689-1727) because their parents were his brother-and sister-in-law. He was one of the boys' trustees under their father's will.
