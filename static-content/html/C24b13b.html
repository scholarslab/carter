</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, February 13 and 17, 1724, reporting large shipments of tobacco from his own and the Lloyd and Burwell estates, and commenting on the "thinness" of the leaves that has prevented tight prizing, and produced lighter hogsheads than usual. He lets Perry know that he intends to take up again the item in his accounts from the merchant in which he is charged 2 1/2 "For receiving bills" which he is very unhappy about. There are great hopes in the colony that the shipments of the last stemmed tobacco they will be allowed to export will bring great prices. He concludes with orders for shoes, noting the "shooe Makers are very cheats" because they make the shoe sizes smaller than they used to. In a post script dated February 17, 1724, Carter notes that he is enclosing bills of lading (not present) for tobacco from his and the Lloyd estates, and alerts the merchant that Mr. Miles, a Maderia merchant, will send a bill for two pipes of wine and that he has ordered one more because this wine is the oinly one he can drink because of his "Gouty condition."
