</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, July 23, 1728, to report that Captain Tarleton does not have room for the last of Pemberton's tobacco, and to enclose an invoice (not present) for goods. He writes that he has bought this year a number of "Gambere" slaves which he prefers over all others, and that Mr. Lee "with your Ship" has gone to Stafford to buy tobacco.

</a> to take in the remains of your <br> Tobacco  but he  has  not room for a hogshead This Serves to Enclose to <br>you an Invoice for Some goods what I propose to have from <br>you this year I am unwilling to delay it any longer that <br>you may have time before you to Send them in Early <br>Therefore for want of a direct Opportunity Send it Via <br> London, 
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negroes have been  poured  in upon Us this year <br>in abundance I have lately bought a  parcel  of <a href="C28g23d.mod.html#n2">Gambere

</a> are to be got for Mr. Lee <br>with your Ship had the good luck to have the good Start of these late <br>Ships which I reckon  has  given him the Opportunity to do <br>better. The last I heard of him he went up into Stafford to buy <br>a Load of  Tobacco  where the <a href="C28g23d.mod.html#n4">Scotch  Merchants

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] This may have been James Tarleton who in 1731 cammanded the <i>The Loyalty
</i>. Several vessels with this name sailed to Virginia. One commanded by Francis Wallis cleared from Poole for Virginia in 1726. Captain Loxom commanded  a vessel of this name in 1729-1730..

</a><br><br><a name="n3"> [3] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] The trading policies of Scots merchants were of considerable concern to Virginia planters and English  merchants at this time, and the matter came before Parliament in 1723. Vessels sent by Scots were crewed by captains and factors authorized to pay good prices in Virginia which enabled them to  obtain full cargoes. English merchants argued that the only way the Scots could afford to pay such good prices was their ability to avoid paying duties on the tobacco at home. Micajah Perry appeared before Parliament and gave statistics of the duties paid by his firm in earlier years and the far smaller amounts paid in the past several years because his ships could not obtain full cargoes in Virginia.
