</a> Accordingly to make payment into your hands but <br>I am to  inform  you of some difficulty that I expect  Captain  Hyde will <br>make in the payment of this money. He tells me  in a letter of the 10th of  November  last
</i> he sold some tobaccos <br>to <a href="C32g11e.mod.html#n1">Alderman Levet
</a> in the years 1725, 1726, &amp; 1727 and that among this <br>tobacco I had in the first Parcel three hogsheads and 4 hogsheads  &amp;

May 21"1726  Captain  Hyde Sends me an account  Current  the <br>29th of June 1727. he sends me another account  Current  the 16th of May <br>1728 he sends me another Account  Current  the 9th of April 1730. he sends <br>me another account  Current  which is the last in none of these accounts <br> Currents  does he make the Least mention to me of this affair they are <br>all without any Salve In that of the 9th of April 1730 he makes the ballan= ce

</a> <br><br><a name="n1">[1] Richard Levett (d. 1740), mercer, represented Aldersgate on the London council from 1722. A mercer according to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i>  is a tradesman "who deals in textile fabrics, esp. silks, velvets, and other fine materials; spec. a member of the Worshipful Company of Mercers, a livery company of the City of London." Levett apparently had other facets to his business besides textiles.

</a><br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
