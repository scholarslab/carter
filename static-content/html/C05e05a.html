</i>New York (Colony). Council Papers. State Archives, New York State Education Department, Albany, Vol. 51, p. 32a-b.  This document was copied for Governor Francis Nicholson's private papers, and was carried by him to New York when he later became governor of that colony. The papers remained in New York, passing into the custody of the State Library which burned around the turn of the twentieth century, causing some damage to this series of records. These records have been transferred to the state archives, and there are several copies of this document in the series. The text was transcribed from one that seems to be most contemporary in its handwriting to the early eighteenth century, and two other copies in the series have been used to supply words in the copy text that were damaged by the fire.
