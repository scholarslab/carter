</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, July 13,1720, concerning a bill of exchange, a shipment of 30 hogsheads oftobacco on board the <i>Brimpton,
</i> Virginiaexpectations of a good marketfor tobacco with the Spanish and French markets now open, and smallernumbers of outport ships in the colony. He had expected to ship moretobacco by the <i>Brimpton,
</i> but Captain Russelhad so much tobacco tocarry he was glad not to have to take more of Carter's which went toLondon. He adds that he has drawn a bill of exchange for &pound;100to Edmund Jenings, complains mildly that he has not received currentaccounts from Tucker, doubles his order for wood flooring blocks, andrepeats an order for Southampton cyder. He concludes with orders forgood white wine and ale, having given up drinking red because of hisgout, and tells Tucker that Captain Russel will give him the Virginianews.
