<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to  London merchant William Dawkins, April 16, 1730, to report that he has received the accounts of sales of his tobacco and that the goods have arrived in good condition. He complains about the extremely low prices received for his tobacco, and comments on the small crops presently in Virginia and Maryland. Most of the letter is devoted to his business in the hands of merchant John Falconar who had died, and his instructions to Dawkins in representing Carter to Falconar's executors. He encloses a letter that Dawkins is to present to the executors.

Mr: William Dawkins<br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have receiv'd your several letters this year your<br>
accounts of sales and your Account Currt. your sales indeed are the lowest<br>
as you observe I think that ever you gave me however to be inginious take<br>
them round they are the best has fallen to my  Lott  for that years Crop  [ . . . ] 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I have receiv'd my goods in good condition the <a href="C30d16b.html#n1"> Bailey 
</a><br>
arriv'd this day three Weeks all that I shall be able to load upon her this year<br>
will be between 50 and 70 hhds how he will come off himself does not yet<br>
Know We have little <a href="C30d16b.html#n2">outport trade
</a> yet the Scotch talk of a great many<br>
fewer ships to come from thence than Usual this probably will very<br>
much help the Londoners the masters are driving about after freight 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>
all the Country over if there be any regard to report [s]  from all parts both<br>
of Virginia and Maryland you may depend upon a Very short crop<br>
I cannot reckon there will be so much by at least 10,000 hhds as went<br>
out <sup><font color="green">from Virginia
</i>
</font>
</sup> Last year for my own part I have Concerns in all our rivers &amp;<br>
 pritty  large ones at the Falls of this [river]
</i>
</font>
</sup>3I am sure I shall fall short of<br>
500 <sup><font color="green">wt
</i>
</font>
</sup> of tobo per share considerably less than I made in the <a href="C30d16b.html#n2"> gust 
</a> year
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yours of the 24th of Janry by the  Haswell,  you tell me you<br>
had sold some of my tobo at 8 1/2 d my letters by that ship advise me<br>
that the market was rising I am in hopes you will be able to advance<br>
the price for what of my tobacco remains unsold you are not<br>
 unsencible  of the Vast Expence we live at Small crops poor  priz= <br>
es great  Salarys  and great  mort4litys  and less for the maintainan<sup><font color="green">ce

</sup><br>
of my  Familys  I cannot Subsist with I can too truely say I grow poorer<br>
and poorer Every Year I live
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of <a href="C30d16b.html#n4">Mr Falconar
</a> fills me full of doubts what is to be=<br>
come of my Affairs in his hands his Son here tells me himself and 2<br>
very Substantial honest men in  London  are his fathers Executors<br>
and promises me all imaginable justice Pressing me Strongly to con <br>
tinue my business to him he seems to be an ingenious man for his years<br>
but old heads are not to be found upon young Shoulders I cannot think it<br>
prudent to continue my Correspondence with that house  till  I see what<br>
Course the young man will steer and I cannot think of any friend I<br>
have in London so proper to  intrust  this Affair to as yourself &amp;<br>
hope you will serve me in it both strenuously and with diligence<br>
Accordingly I send you  inclosed  a letter to Mr Falconars Executors<br>
Whereby to demand of them an Accot of my Concerns and to receive<br>
of them the money that is due to me from Mr Falconar upon his<br>
accot  Currant  and also the produce of certain quantities <sup><font color="green">of tobo

Curtts of late the first of them Bears date June 10th.. 1728. In this<br>
account his  ballance  in my favour is &pound;1121"9"8 herein he gives<br>

of April 1728. He sends me another account Currt date June<br>
14th 1729 the  ballance  due to me in that Accot is &pound;1099"12"1<br>
In that accot he gives me Credit for 8 hhds by <a href="C30d16b.html#n7">James Bradby

In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price.

<br><br><a name="n15"> [15] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
