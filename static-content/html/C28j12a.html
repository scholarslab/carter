<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, October 12, 1728, to order rugs, blankets, cloth for bedding, and sieves. He suggests to the merchant that he will be willing to own an eighth share in a new ship to be named for himself, and captained by Tom Dove as he is assuming that the <i>Carter
</i> will be sold.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
