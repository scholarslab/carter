</a>
</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes July 3, 1723, to Thomas Hooper,  a resident of Stafford County and manager of Carter's affairs in that area, chastising him for disputing an Assembly election in that county that has damaged Hooper's reputation. He then chides Hooper for failing to carry out surveys of lands in Stafford on Carter's behalf, especially of a tract between Carter and Mann Page. Carter's  sloop is coming to Hooper's areas to pick up tobacco, and Carter hopes that James Carter has finished collections of quit rents so that they can be sent. George Mason and Carter have settled accounts of quit rents but Henry Fitshugh  has not. He urges Hooper to write at length of their business affairs and send the letter by the sloop. Carter closes with a note that he has not heard of any progress regarding the Brenton grant, and by urging Hooper to assist James Carter in rapidly dispatching the sloop.

</i>  pp. 49-50, 52, 54.
</a> The date of this letter was misread by Wright who printed it as July 3, 1720; there was no Assembly in 1720. The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft. It was written on pages of the letter book that were very absorbent, allowing much bleed through of the ink, and making transcription very difficult. In addition, there is a hole affecting some words.
</a><br><br>The words "May It plea" that appear before Hooper's name as addressee apparently were written by the clerk as the beginning of a letter to the governor. Thinking better of writing that letter here, the clerk turned over the page and began again, but forgot to strike "May It plea."
</a><br><br>Carter  added to this letter in two places on succeeding pages of the letter book and these additions have been joined to this letter as he intended. The next-to-last paragraph appears on folio 20. Apparently the clerk turned the page to write the sentence below a letter to Governor Spotswood. The ink of this sentence is the same as that of the letter to Captain Hooper that comes to the foot of folio 19.  The final paragraph was written into the letter book between letters of September 27, 1720, to Messrs. Perry and to John Carter, but it clearly is a post script to the letter to Hooper, and has been added to it. Wright printed them where they appeared in the letter book as his edition followed the order of the pages.
