</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes  to his son John Carter, February 10, 1721,thenin London, concerning his lease of the Northern Neck proprietary,asking John to clarify with Colonel William Cage, one of LadyFairfax's trustees, whether land grants in the proprietary thatCarter makes must carry only the name of the underage Lord Fairfax,or those of his trustees as well. He turns to the question of theBrent Town grant within the proprietary, the need for a survey of its30,000 acres, and the difficulties that shroud taking up lands therewhen the bounds remain unknown. He asks John to pursue the questionof a survey with Robert Bristow, the current owner of the Brentongrant, and also asks him to contact the heirs of London Alderman JohnJeffreys concerning the 14,000 acres granted to Cadwallader Jones inStafford County that has not been settled, and which has not paidquit rents.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] This sentence was written into the draft by RobertCarter as is indicated by the use of italics.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Quit rent was the term used for thepayment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," inthis case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as theproprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services wererequired of the landholder as had been true in mediaevaltimes.
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Cadwallader Jones (1652?-1700?), an Indian traderand fighter, was lieutenant colonel of the Stafford militia. FairfaxHarrison writes that "in 1677 he patented, with David Jones, 17,114acres in the Stafford backwoods . . . on the drains of Accotink andPohick."

</a>) He got into financial trouble, and left forEngland in 1687. The holders of many of his debts were the Jeffreys,prominent London merchants. The alderman to whom RC refers is JohnJeffreys (1614-1688), master of the Grocers Company and alderman in1661. He was in business with his nephew, Sir Jeffrey Jeffreys, MP,who was his heir. ( J. R.
