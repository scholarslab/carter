</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, December 16, 1727, to alert him that the governor has renewed his son Robert's appointment as naval officer, and that he wishes Dawkins once again to join with merchant Robert Cary in being Robert's security in England. He notifies Dawkins that the Surveyor General of Customs in the southern colonies, Richard Fitzwilliams, desires to have the naval officer located at Urbanna where the collector of customs is located, and asks Dawkins to oppose this move if Fitzwilliams pushes it at home. In a lengthy post script dated February 20, 1728, Carter comments on Isaac Lee's debt to Dawkins and his attempts to collect it for the merchant, recommends Dawkins forget about collecting other debts, notes that the <i>Carter 
</i> will once again be late in reaching the colony which will affect the business she can expect, and complains that Dawkins has not sold his tobacco.

</b> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. Carter inserted in his hand a long addition to the draft at the beginning of the second paragraph as is indicated by the use of bold italics.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] The naval officer was an official in the colony that reported to the Commissioners of Customs, a body that had first been established in 1663; the group was reorganized several times, especially after 1688. The board was "intrusted with collection of customs both in England and the colonies." The board helped write many of the instructions for colonial governors in collaboration with the Privy Council. "Their direct connection with the colonies was through the governors, who were instructed to correspond with the commissioners, and to send them, every three months, lists of clearances, and also reports of illegal trading. The governor's agent in matters of trade was the naval officer whom he was empowered to appoint, but who was required by the 7th and 8th William III to give security to the commissioners of customs."

</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] As Surveyor General of the Customs in the colonies in "South America," Richard Fitzwilliams was a member of the councils of Virginia, South Carolina, and Jamaica. He had come to Virginia in 1717, and "powerful political friends quickly brought him the post of collector of customs in the lower James River district and then his . . . position as surveyor general and elevation to the Council in 1725." He served with William Byrd on  the commission to survey the boundary between Virginia and North Carolina in 1728.<br><br>"The Virginia Company of London appointed a surveyor general for Virginia in 1621, and the crown continued to appoint surveyors general after Virginia became a royal colony in 1624. From 1693 until the Revolutionary War, the College of William and Mary was responsible for the Office of the Surveyor General, which appointed official surveyors and received one-sixth of the fees that they collected."
