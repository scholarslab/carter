</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, July 15,1720, concerning Dawkins' business affairs with Richard Lee, notingthat Lee's father "was my Intimate friend" who had charged Carterwith looking after his children which "makes me the unfittest personin the world to go into harsh measures agst. him." He assures Dawkinsthat Lee is honest but "too unsteady &amp; too careless &amp; easie"to do business for others. Lee will pledge his estate against thedebts if Dawkins insists, but Carter points out that, afterdeductions for items due Lee, there will not be much balance dueDawkins. Carter notes that he will do whatever Dawkins wishes, buthopes that harsh measures will not be necessary.
