</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, September 17, 1723, requesting that he find tradesmen for Carter including a carpenter, bricklayer, and barber surgeon. He reminds Perry that his grandfather had often found such men for him, discusses the wages he is willing to pay, and hopes they will sign five-year indentures. He sends copies (not present) of some letters received by Scots merchants that describe changes in the customs officers in Scotland which have depressed the merchants. Carter hopes that these reports are true and that the merchants will have to become "honest Men in spiite of their Teeths." He closes with a report of the poor crop in the colony, and in a post script, urges Perry to find a barber surgeon who will not require wages.
