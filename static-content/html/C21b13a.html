</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, February 13, 1721, to thank him for news of his sons studying in England, and comments on Dawkins' dismal reports "of the Stock Jobbing Trade." He then responds to Dawkins' complaints about the quality of his tobacco. He promises to let Captain Baily Kent "hear of this foolish prateling on both Sides of his Ears" for carrying false tales about a  part of Carter's tobacco production. There are outport ships in Virginia taking advantage of the larger merchants holding back their ships from an early voyage, and some colonists are rushing to obtain good freight rates. He hopes the <i>Carter
</i> will arrive safely next month.

</a> You tell a Dismal Storey of the fatal Effects <br>of the Stock Jobbing Trade and Every body Else  chymes  upon the <br>Same  noat  thank God our Merchants had more foresight than to be <br> catcht  wth these  Tricherus   baites,  The worst part of Yor.  Storey  to <br>me is the Sad Account You give me of my Tobo. I am at a loss what ansr. <br>to make to You I take as Vigilant a Care to prevent these things as <br>any man no one can boast of better Lands or better Materials <br>to work with. My Overseers are under as Strict orders and as penal <br>obligations as I can put them --  The  cheif  part of the Tobos.  <br>You had of me both in the <a href="Cbiodir.html#CS"> Carter  
</a>and the   Baily   was made <br>at some of my best plans.  after I have done my utmost there <br>will be some Indifferent hogsheads which must keep Company <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2
