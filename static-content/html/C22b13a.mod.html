</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Cage, trustee of Lady Fairfax's estate, drafts a letter to Robert Carter, February 13, [1722], concerning the affairs of the Northern Neck proprietary in Virginia, and especially the debts due the estate from Edmund Jenings, the leaseholder who preceded Carter. He authorizes Carter "to Act as you think fit" in attempting to collect the debts. He hopes Carter will be able to make improvements in the lease which he will share with Cage and Fairfax, and notes that they stand ready to negotiate a new lease with Carter for whatever length Carter may propose. He sees Lord Fairfax rarely because of the latter's army service, but sends Carter Fairfax's "humble service" and reminds Carter's of Fairfax's influence with the Board of Trade.

</a><br><br><br>This letter is a draft; the top of the sheet has been extensively damaged with much loss of text. A date is written in the margin apparently by Cage, probably at a later date; it reads "Febry. the 13th: 1711" with the last figure very faint.  The reference to the death of "old Mr. Perry" in the text means, however, that this draft cannot be earlier than 1721 October 1 when Micajah Perry, Sr., died. Louis Wright, in a list of the Fairfax Papers appended to his  <i>Letters of Robert Carter
</i>  dates this draft as 1718. The Huntington Library's file folder, during the editor's visit there in 1983, bore the date 1723[/24].  However, by the way in which Cage refers to the death of Perry, it seems that the death was recent, and the draft has, accordingly, been dated 1722.

</a><br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Fairfax refers to his mother, Catherine Culpeper, widow of the fifth Lord Fairfax (d. 1710); from her father, the 2nd Lord Culpeper, she had inherited about 1689 his five-sixths interest in the Northern Neck Proprietary in Virginia. When she died in 1719, she bequeathed her Virginia property to her young son Tom, and made Wiliam Cage and Edward Filmer trustees of the proprietary. Filmer soon died, and Cage, a kinsman of the 6th Lord Fairfax, became the sole trustee. From his grandmother, Margaret Lady Culpeper, the 6th Lord Fairfax inherited the other one-sixth of the Proprietary.
