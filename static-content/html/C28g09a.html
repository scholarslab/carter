</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in his letter to Bradley of <a href="C27e17a.html"target="_wblank">May 17, 1727,
</a> Bradley owned the <i>Welcome,
</i> but little information about Bradley has been located. (There is a listing of the firm of Bradly &amp; Griffin, Merchants, Fenchurch-street, opposite the Mitre Tavern, on page 13 of   <i><xref to="freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~frpayments/KD1740/AB.htm">Kent's Directory 
</a>For the Year 1740 Containing An Alphabetical List of the Names and Places of Abode of the Directors of Companies, Persons in Publick Business, Merchants, and other Eminent Traders in the Cities of London and Westminster, and the Borough of Southwark.
</i>   [London: Printed and Sold by Henry Kent in Finch-Lane, near the Royal Exchange: and by the Booksellers and Pamphlets Shops of London and Westminster, 1740]. p. 39. Online, examined 8/12/2005 and 6/14/2012.

</a> <br><br><a name="n2"> [2] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.

</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] The 140 ton <i>Welcome
</i> was owned by London merchant James Bradley to whom Carter would write about her on <a href="C27e17a.html"target="_wblank"> May 17, 1727
</a>. John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1728. ( Adm 68/195, 154r, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.

</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Carter uses the word "strait" in the sense of "A narrow or tight place, a time of sore need or of awkward or straitened circumstances, a difficulty or fix."   (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.
