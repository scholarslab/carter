</b> Letter book, 1731 July 9-1732 July 13 , Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. Thsi draft haz been water-stained in the middle and some of the text is extremely faint.
</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Richard Oswald (1687-1766) was a prominent Glasgow merchant who was "involved in West Indies and Madeira trade as well as tobacco importation." In partnership with his brother Alexander, the firm owned three ships (the <i>Martha,
</i> the <i>Amity,
</i> and the <i>Speedwell
</i>) of the 41 sailing from Glasgow in 1735. ( Devine, T.M.  <i>The Tobacco Lords: A Study of the Tobacco Merchants of Glasgow and their Trading Activites c. 1740-90.
</i> [ Edinburgh: John Donald Publishers Ltd.] p. 183;
</a> and "The <a href="http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/smihou/smihou087.htm"target="_wblank">Old Country Houses
</a> of the Old Glasgow Gentry: LXXXVII: Scotstoun." . 8/2/2005, 10/23/2015.)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] The <i>Martha
</i>  was commanded by a Captain Dunlop and owned by Richard Oswald &amp; Company; see Carter to Richard Oswald &amp; Company 1729 August 11, and Carter to Oswald, 1731 July 27.

<br><br><a name="n3"> [3] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See  <a href="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm"target="_wblank">"Bill of Exchange"
</a> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] This may have been Patrick Cheap, a merchant from Urbanna in Middlesex County. (Rutman and Rutman, A Place in Time: Middlesex. . . . p. 247.)
