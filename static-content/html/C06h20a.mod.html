</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Arthur Bailey, August 20, 1706, to advise him of a bill of exchange that he and Gawin Corbin as trustees have drawn on the account of the estate of Ralph Wormeley for plank Carter furnished to William Churchill for a mill on Wormeley lands, and that he had drawn a bill payable to Henry Fox for quit rents on Wormeley lands in King William County. He instructs Bailey to pay any balance left in the Wormeley account to another merchant, John Goodwin.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter often referred to in their youth as his "Cozns." Ralph Wormeley (ca. 1681-1714), Ralph Wormeley's (d.1701) oldest son; and John Wormeley (1689-1727) because their parents were his brother-and sister-in-law. He was one of the boys' trustees under their father's will.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Henry Fox (d. 1714), a justice and burgess of St. John's Parish, King William County. (<a href="Cbibl.html#A25">"Fox Family of King William County, Va."
</a>)
</a> <br><br><a name="n3">[3] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.
