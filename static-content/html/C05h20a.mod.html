</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter advises William Robinson, ca. August 20, 1705, that the new governor, Edward Nott, has agreed to an election for members of the House of Burgesses, and that Robinson's Richmond County neighbor, John Tarpley, then the sherif, will probably work against Robinson's re-election. Carter adds that it will be necessary that complaints about former Governor Nicholson's administration, especially about the actions of the collector and of the Naval Officer of the Rappahannock, come from several counties, and that he sends two pages about Nicholson that have been copied from a book.

RC wrote the draft of this portion of his letter on the inverted blank portion of the verso of the letter to him from St. John Shropshire, 1705 August 16. The draft is undated, but could not have been written earlier than when Shropshire's letter to him was written. The draft breaks off as RC ran out of space.
