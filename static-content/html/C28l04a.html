 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to Robert Jones, December 4, 1728

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his manager, Robert Jones of Prince William County, December 4, 1728, to chastise him for his "abundance of words" and lack of action, and to let Jones know that he has a good candidate to replace him. He will give Jones one more year but if Jones is planning to move, he wishes to know at once so that he may hire the candidate. He then turns to the disappointing wheat crop and poor quantities of tallow. He gives specific instructions for the herding of his hogs down from plantation to plantation, noting that he has promised certain of the hands that they may come "down" at Christmas, and they could herd the hogs. He writes of the need  to present the deeds for lots in Falmouth to the county court, and hopes that Jones and two other witnesses to the deeds will be present.

</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>Decr. 4th. 1728<br><br>
Mr Robt Jones<br>
 


<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now upon yours of the 7th of Novr: if abundance of <br>words would Answer the want of Deeds I must Allow you would pass for one <br>of the best managers I ever had to do with but where there wants performan=<br>ces this wordy talent is of little value in my esteem I shall only tell you upon <br>your huge promises I Shall adventure to make a  tryal  of you one year long<br> [e] r that is to enter into Fresh Articles with you when your last year is up <br> altho  I have now the offer of a very good man to come into your place <br> [who]  has behav'd himself very well in business of the same nature with <br>yours And is clear of A Burthensome family which you know is no sm-<br>all charge to me in yours being so large so that it is very much in consider-<br>tion of the straights you would be Under that brings me into the humor <br>of continuing you Another year And therefore if you will be so  chearfull  &amp; <br>easy Under a present remove as you seem to hint I am very willing you sho-<br>uld take your leave of me as soon as you have  performd  the conditions <br>of your last years Agreemt. and this I would have you Advise me of by the <br>first  Oppertunity  that I may close with the person now Offering himself <br>of whose both industry and Ability I have a very good Opinion
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now take into consideration the Accot you <br>send me of the Wheat and other things you tell me of Seven Bushels and <br>one half I spent which was very great House keeping considering I was so <br>Much of my time at the Out quarters but that I do not Much mind it <br>more Concerns me that you have sowed no more certainly there might <br>have four or five bushels been sowed there as well as At the Other qrs: <br>especially considering How convenient the Wheat there is the crops <br>at the Other qrs: fall a great deal short of what the overseers told me <br>some of them at Least Sabin  talkd  of a hundred Bushels so did Willia [ms]  <br>at the least and So did Cassety the Butter pots are a pretty many in <br>number they are most of them but small I wish you had Added the 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>
wts Upon your Tickets and I wish that the small quantities of butter <br>made may not be the Occasion of the Loss of several of the Calves several  [of]  <br>them were so poor and Small that without a great deal of care const<br>ant housing and good feeding they will not be winter'd  Altho  with <br>good care I am  satisfyed  they may for from my own Experience this very <br>year several poor Calves by housing and feeding with the benefit of <br>the Corn fields are grown to be likely &amp; lusty and no fear of  wintring  <br>them
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of  Hoggs  you tell me you reckon'd upon to be <br> fattned  at the several qrs: amount to 86 Out of these After the over=<br>seers have their Share some for the people and what will be for your <br>provision I hope you will be able to Afford me Fifty or at Least near it <br>And I would have of the best of them too Some meat must be kept for <br><a href="C28l04a.html#n1">Hurst
</a> while he is at work Upon the <a href="C28l04a.html#n2">Town
</a> houses Now I am upon <br>that Subject tis proper to let you know that I have got a promise of <a href="Cbiodir.html#RC1">Mr <br>Chichester
</a> to get what Fraiming Stuff I have Occasion for off of h [is]  <br>Land for my buildings at the Town which will save a great deal of La [bour] 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="C28l04a.html#n3">Tallow
</a> you send me Down is of very different wts: your beef <br>yielded 31 pounds the <a href="Cbiodir.html#RF1">RichLand
</a> 33 pounds and one half the <a href="Cbiodir.html#PQ">Park
</a> 18 3/4 pounds and the <a href="Cbiodir.html#PQ1">Pop<br>lar
</a> but 14 1/4 pounds. yours and RichLand is a great deal short of what I <br> Usd  to have but Certainly Williams &amp; Sabin have play'd the rogue <br>egregiously in their Tallow
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What  Hoggs  I am to have I must have them Drove down to me <br>and I would have them come in Two  parcells  as <a href="C28l04a.html#n4">Roger Oxford
</a> indeed pro<br>pos'd to Me to be the best way its very common to the Southward to drive <br> Hoggs  as far they put them into Large enclosures three or four days be=<br>fore they set off with them and Drive them about with Horses and <br>then they tell me they manage them with a great deal of ease there are <br>Several Gentlemen in the way that I dare say would Afford them con<br>veniencys for <sup><font color="green">a
