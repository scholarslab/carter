</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to [Philip Ludwell], July 23, 1726, responding to the news of the death of the governor, Hugh Drysdate, the night before. He states his inability to go to Williamsburg for several days because the <i>Carter
</i> which lies before his home is ready to sail and he must prepare documents and letters to go with her. He sends instructions that the funeral is to proceed without him, and that he is notifying other members of the Council.

</a><br><br>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading of Carter's home, "Corotoman," on the letter. The addressee's name has been learned from Carter's diary entry for this date in which he wrote, "6 Clock Coll Ludwells Express came wth the Accot of the Govrs Death after 2 the morning before. . . ."
</a><br><br>This is the recipient's copy in the hand of a clerk and bearing Carter's large and prominent signature. There is no address on the outer leaf as it was certainly handed to Philip Ludwell's messenger for immediate delivery. The letter was closed with a wax seal that has left a stain on the paper.
