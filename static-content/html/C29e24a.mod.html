Majr Holloway<br>
 
<br>Sir -- <br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be improper for me to give you the best Scheme I <br>can   according  to my Informations
</i> how the river of  Potomac  branches  take their  Courses 
</i> above the falls thereof
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many runs making into the Northern Neck which <br>all of them are Inhabited more or less, One of them about 30 mil [e] s above the Falls is &amp;<br>Called <a href="C29e24a.mod.html#n1">Goose Creek
</a>  up to this Creek and above it is inhabited
</i> the branches of this is  reckoned  to lock into the Northern branches <br>of the North Stream of Rappahannock as  you
</i> will observe by Savage's  Plat,  beyond Goose <br>Creek about 15 Miles comes down a ridge of  <S><font color="red">Small
</font>
</S>  mountains from Rappahannock <br>Almost to the very side of  Potomac  river and is Called by the hunters the blue <br>ridge beyond this blue ridge about a Mile up the run of  Potomac  the river <br>forks, the main river which the  Indians
</i> call <a href="C29e24a.mod.html#n2">Cohunkaruta 
</a>keeps up to the Westward <br>the other branch which makes this fork runs away to the South West  Called  by <br>the Indians  Shenandoah  and by the Inhabitants Jerundo, This branch is Sup<br>posed to run above the branches of Rappahannock after it has left the great Stream of <br> Potomac  a Considerable way it may be 40 or 50 Miles it forks again &amp; in <br>this fork as I am  informed  <a href="C29e24a.mod.html#n3">Larkin Chew
</a> and his Company made their <br>Surveys I must own below this fork of  Shenandoah,  on the upper Side of it, not <br>far from the mouth of it where it leaves the main river Cohunkaruta I have <br>had lately 2 or 3 Surveys made but have  passed  no Deeds for Lands there <br>not that I can See any the least reason to doubt these Lands being Expressly <br>within <a href="C29e24a.mod.html#n4">the Grant,
</a> If the words of it have any plain meaning even from the <br>Doctrine that  has  taken awy the lower fork  of Rappad [an] 
</i> from the  Proprietors  where the only <br>reason pretended is that the Northern branch is the bigger &amp; larger Stream,
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maryland Grant bounds it self   [<i>sic
</i>]
</i> by Cohunkaruta <br>and is inhabited a great way above the mouth of  Shenandoah, 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Send you this  Entertainment  for your  Consideration and to <br>have your  Opinion whether by any fair Interpretation these Lands above <br> Shenandoah  can be Construed out of  proprietors  Grant and  to
</i> belong to the Crown It <br>Seems my passing a Deed or two in the  Second  fork of the Northern  branches
</i> of Rappahannock under my <br>presumption in making Some Surveys upon the upper side of  Shenandoah  <br>is  looked  upon as a Crime so heinous That nothing less is threatned then the <br>Destruction of the  proprietors  Grant for it.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its the wise mans Saying in the multitudes of  Counselors  <br>there is Safety and I Always have a very great dependance upon your  Opinion <br>in these  Perplexed  Cases  Although  I think this cannot properly be called a <br> Perplexed  Case,
</p>
