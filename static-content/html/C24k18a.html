</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, November 18, 1724, to summarize the state of the law suit that he has brought in the colony to establish the proprietor's rights to certain fees and fines. The trial was postponed, and Governor Drysdale intends to seek the opinion of the Board of Trade. Carter requests that a copy of the letter be sent to William Cage (the trustee of the Fairfax estate) and Lord Fairfax.
