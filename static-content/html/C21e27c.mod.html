</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant, William Dawkins, May 27, 1721, reporting that freight rates on ships in the York River have been lowered to &pound;8 and those in the James River to &pound;7. The <i>Carter
</i> must look for freight at &pound;8 if she is to be loaded, but she is doing well thanks to his assistance. He wishes her captain, Bailey Kent, were more aggressive in seeking cargo. He complains about the pirates and the Crown's apparent lack of interest in protecting the colonial trade.
