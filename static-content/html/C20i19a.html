</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins,September 19, 1720, expressing hope that the <hirend="italics">Carter
</i>
</b> has arrivedsafely, and suggesting that Dawkins send her back to the colony assoon as possible because there is a very good crop this year, "thequality of It surpasses wt. has bin this many Years." He complainsthat he has not had a letter from Dawkins since April and hopes thatthe shoes he has ordered will arrive "before the frost Setts in hardupon us." Dawkins' report of his sales of 66 hogsheads of Carter'stobacco has arrived, and Carter notes that it probably was the lastbatch Dawkins will be able to sell at such prices. He resolves tosend Dawkins "none but nice goods," and requests that Dawkins givehis blessings to his sons Robert and Charles, then studying inEngland. He concludes by reporting that Dick Lee has been very illbut is recovering.
