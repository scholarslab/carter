</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to the Board of Trade and Plantations, January 14, 1727,  that he has carried out instructions directed by the Board to the late governor by giving instructions to the various officers to prepare accounts of the taxes collected under various acts; he expects to send the accounts soon. He sends the Council journals, and will send  the journal of a recent meeting once it has been read and approved. Also sent are various reports of taxes, and the Naval Officers' records of imports and exports. The Assembly had been prorogued by the governor before his death, and that proroguation has been continued. Carter intends to propose at the next Council that the Assembly be further prorogued until a new govenor arrives. He closes by reporting the death of Council member Philip Ludwell.
