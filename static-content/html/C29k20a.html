<br>Sir -- <br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acquainted <a href="C29k20a.html#n2">your son
</a> in  Williamsburgh  of the agreement <br>
I had made with <a href="C29k20a.html#n3">Benj Robinson
</a> for his Wifes part of the Tract of Land <br>
at <a href="C29k20a.html#n4">Arnolds Ferry
</a> &amp; told him how well pleased I should be if you would give <br>
your self the Trouble to appear there at the partition between the two Sisters <br>
that the division might be equal in respect to the Quantity quality and <br>
Conveniences of the Land which yu. know very well tht. I cannot think <br>
of so fit a person &amp; your son made me hope you Would readily undertak [e] <br>
 it &amp; you have always been so forward in your friendship towards me tht. <br>
I am in no doubt you Will take this trouble upon you
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Robinson Writes me word <a href="C29k20a.html#n5">Mrs. Wormeley
</a> agrees <br>
to Save Charges tht. this division shall be made without a Sheriff and <br>
a jury, that a Surveyor shall run the Bounds of the Land to find the Quantity, &amp; <br>
then run a divisional Line; &amp; afterwards the Choice between the two Sisters to be deter=<br>
mined by balloting. Major <a href="C29k20a.html#n6">Matthew Kemp
</a> is pitched upon by Mrs Wormley <br>
to act in her behalf, &amp; I will hope you will appear in my Stead. I need not tell <br>
you I shall want a good River Landing, an equal part of the best of the Land <br>
an equal part of the timber, &amp; an equal party of the uncleared Lands; an equal <br>
part of the Marsh &amp; an equal part of the rest of the Conveniences
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Robinson  hath  promised to be there, &amp; be as strenuous <br>
in getting as good a Choice as if he was to keep the Land. The <a href="C29k20a.html#n6">patent
</a> is for a <br>
thousand Acres. Mr. Robinson undertakes it will hold out that Qty, &amp; <br>
believes within the Bounds there will be found a hundred or two hundred <br>
Acres more. The dividing Line between the two Sisters ought to be very, <br>
plainly marked. Mr Kemp  hath  fixed the time for this Work to the 15th of next <br>
Month, as agreeing best with his Business; &amp; I shall be glad it will suit you <br>
also. I intend to write to <a href="C29k20a.html#n7">William Camp
</a> the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's <br>
Affairs to take a View of the Land two or three days before, &amp; to give you all the <br>
Assistance he can in the performance. I shall give you no futher trouble 
from, 
 
</p>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sr <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your most ready humble Servant
