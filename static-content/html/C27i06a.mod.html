</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Peter Leheup, an English Treasury clerk, was Virginia's (1722-1754)  and other colonies' agent in England for many years. "Peter Leheup was one of those almost invisible behind-the scenes personalities whose exsposure reveals so much about the character of eighteenth-century society and administration."  He became underclerk (later, chief clerk) at the Treasury in 1721, and married that year "Clara the daughter of William Lowndes, secretary of the treasury. . . . Very early his father-in-law . . .  made him a comptroller of exchequer bills. In addition, he served for decades (c. 1721-1742) as deputy to Horatio Walpole in his capacity as Auditor-General of Plantation Revenues." ( Jacob M.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Established in 1696 as successor to a similar body, the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations was "an advisory group, subordinate to king and Privy Council, and with no executive, financial, or penalizing powers, the Board of Trade was nevertheless able . . . to exert a far reaching and often determining influence in colonial matters. . . . It prepared the royal instructions for the governors overseas. . . ." ( Henry Hartwell, James Blair, and Edward Chilton. Hunter Dickinson Farish, <i>ed.
