</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to John Savage, April 13, 1724, to repeat and emphasize the instructions for surveys Savage is to make for Carter on the colony's frontier. He reminds Savage that Thomas Barber is to assist with the work, and that Carter is sending to Savage by Barber some deeds for lands in the area of Bull Run. Some surveys were made in the area ten years earlier, but Savage is to ignore them.
