<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, July 13, 1723, concerning the value of the Virginia estate of his niece's husband, John Lloyd, which Perry is negotiating to buy for Carter. He estimates the value of slave, and notes that cattle and  horses have only modest value whensold individually, and that hogs have no market value. Carter has managed the estate for many years. He tells Perry to let the sellers know that he will match any other offer, and will pay as promptly as the  sellers wish.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already sent you an Inventory of the <br><a href="Cbiodir.html#LL">LL

</sup> to Sell and <br>can make a good title, however, I shall give you here the best <br>Accot. I can, how the prices of Virginia Estates run from man <br>to man, as for Negroes Suppose you know the prices they are <br>Sold at well Enough, two Year ago <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP1">Coln. Page

of Capt y Francs. Willis Agent of the <a href="C23g13a.html#n1">African company
</a> at Seven<br>teen pound per head, last Year I bought men for Twenty Women <br>Eighteen and Girls of 10 and 12 Years of age for 10 pound per <br>head, this Year I know of no large Quantity have been sold <br>together, the small folks and Middling people have been <br>the only buyers. I have known  Severall  Single choice men <br>bought for 20&pound;  peice  the choicest have gone at 40&pound; <br>this  hath  been the rule with the Sellers as far as I have heard <br>I doubt not would I have taken a Quantity I might have <br>had them considerably cheaper, You must know the Slaves <br> <S><font color="red">such as

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Cattle there is no Such thing as Selling a stock <br>together for  <S><font color="red">ready
</font>
</S>  Money, the common price for a young fat <br>Cow in killing time is Thirty five Shillings Cash and for a <br>Steer 7 Year old Fifty Shillings this you may be Informed of <br>by your Masters when they buy fresh meat,  <S><font color="red">The horses and mares 
</font>
</S> 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horses and mares you must understand are <br>of very small Value among us they swarm upon us and are <br>degenerated into such runts that you may buy them as they <br>run almost for any thing, not many Years ago I sold Six out <br>of my pasture to <a href="Cbiodir.html#JL">Doctr. Lomax
</a> of three Years old for shipping <br>of as 20S per head some of these you will observe are very old <br>and some very Young,
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the  hoggs  I dont know what to say to them <br>as they run in the woods  wee  Esteem them

</font>
</sup> little better  then   Vermine,  <br>and tis not common to put them into the Inventory of our Estates, <br>Indeed after  wee  have spent a  Barrell  of Corn upon them per  hogg  <br>to make them  fitt  for killing, they will fetch you from 20S: to 25S:
<br>per head the Barrows and  Spaid  Sows <sup><font color="green">of 3 years old
</i>
</font>
</sup>  Currant  Money, for the <br> houshold  goods tis very old and mean as you may very well <br>conceive having been under the use of such various hands, <br>There is 9 of the Negroes as I have already observed are so much

past their labour that they are rather a charge  then  anything <br>Else, their Levy and  cloathes  come to more then they make <br>there is three of them at one place put in for a Share and at <br>no place under two for a Share and a lusty Girl or Boy to <br>help out with their work to Boot, and yet the Overseers Grumble <br>very much to allow any thing for them,
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lands and Plantations you have often had a <br> perticular  Accot. of, when Carey has got that plantation away <br>as no <sup><font color="green">doubt

</font>

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a true representation of this Estate; old <br><a href="C23g13a.html#n2">Capt. Willis
</a> knows as well the value of a Virginia Estate as any <br>man let him but consider the great difference there is between <br>Lands in those parts of the  Countrey  and  Gloster  where he <br>lived, the low Ebb that Tobbo is at and the little Income we <br>make at this day of our Virginia Estates and I could almost <br>agree he should set the Value upon it himself,
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess in regard I have had this Estate so <br>long under my Government that the best of the Slaves went from <br>hence with <a href="Cbiodir.html#ECL"><sup><font color="green">my

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The Royal African Company, founded in 1672, grew out of earlier slave-trading companies that had been founded in the middle of the  seventeenth century, and that held monopolies on the English trade in slaves. The trade proved so  profitable that Parliament was lobbied successfully to rescind the monopoly and open the trade to anyone which happened in 1698. Carter anticipates that the company will fight the proposed tax on imported slaves even through it is to be paid by the colonial purchasers, not the importers. He was correct for the law was not allowed to stand due to lobbying against it in England.
