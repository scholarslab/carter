</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins November 29, 1723, that he has learned that Robert Jones has lost his case tried in England. He informs the merchant that he wishes to be involved without his name being connected with it in another case that will be appealed from the judgment of the General Court in Virginia to England. The case was brought by a wealthy "Esqr. Hallow's," who lives near Liverpool against the heirs of Manley in Virginia. Carter recused himself from sitting on the case because he had bought an estate from Manley, and reports that Edmund Jenings's vote carried it before the council even though he is so old and infirm that he really does not know what he is voting on.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter refers to the legal process of entail which is "to restrict (property) by limiting the inheritance to the owner's lineal descendants or to a particular class thereof "; or  "to convert (an estate) into a 'fee tail' (feudum talliatum); to settle (land, an estate, etc.) on a number of persons in succession, so that it cannot be bequeathed at pleasure by any one possessor."

</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] John Hallowes (Hallows) (1615-1657) had come to Maryland as an indentured servant, but later moved to Westmoreland County where he acquired extensive tracts of land. Some of that land was purchased in 1733 by Thomas Lee from Samuel Hallowes of County Lancaster, England, who "as a great newphew of Major John Hallowes," had acquired title in an important legal case decided in 1722, probably the one to which Carter refers. This land became part of Stratford. Carter may have hoped to acquire a tract from Samuel Hallowes to add to Nomini (see fn4)  as John Hallowes had lived near that plantation of Carter's. John Randolph sailed to England in 1727 to become the colony's agent, and represented Hallowes in negotiations with Carter.

</i>), and inherited  considerable land in the county, David Eaton wites, "Manly also gathered in one body the large tract called 'Nomini Hall' and sold the same to the Hon. Robert Carter, March 11, 1712. W[estmoreland] D[eed] B[ook] 2, page 71." ( "Notes."  <i>William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine,
