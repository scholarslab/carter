</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter as acting governor of the colony writes to the Board of Trade, June 29, 1727, to send lists (not present) of the approximately 1200 Negroes imported since "Lady day 1718 to Lady day 1727." He reports that restitution has been made to the owners of the ship <i>John &amp; Betty
</i> for duties on its rum collected that were proved not due. He cannot send the latest Council minutes because they have not been read and approved. He informs the board of the Council order that merchant ships leave the colony in fleets, and hopes that the new governor will take steps, when he arrives, to strengthen the defences in the colony if the war with Spain continues.

</sup>Virginia &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>June the 29th 1727<br><br> <br>My Lords<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In obedience to Yor Lordps commands, I here  inclose  <br>Lists of all the Negros imported into this Colony from <a href="C27f29a.html#n1">Lady day
</a> 1718 <br>to Lady day 1727: there have been upwards of twelve hundred imported since <br>and more daily expected, but none from the <a href="C27f29a.html#n2">African company.
</a>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my last to Yor Lordps (whereof a Duplicate is inclosed) <br>the Owners of the Ship  John &amp; Betty  of Bristol have made proof <br>of that ships arrival on the 10th of June 1726 and being then at <br>anchor in Rappahannock River, and orders are given conformable <br>to Yor Lordps commands for restoring the money received for the duty <br>of the Rum imported therein.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herewith Yor Lordps will receive the Duplicates of the Council <br>Journals sent in my last dispatch, since which there has been one <br>Meeting of the Council as the Court of Oyer &amp; Terminer held this month <br>but as the Minutes have not yet been read &amp; approved I cannot send them <br>by this conveyance. The most  matereal  point then under consideration <br>was the safety of the Trade, now that a <a href="C27f29a.html#n3">War is begun with Spain
</a> <br>whose Settlement at St Augustine is like to prove dangerous to the <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>Navigation of these Plantations. to prevent this it has been <br>judged necessary to order the Merchant Ships to Sail hence in Fleets <br>under the Convoy of the Man of war on this Station, which will <br>go in company with them a convenient distance off this Coast <br>and tis hoped the two Fleets directed to be formed (according to the <br>inclosed Resolution of the Council) will include all the Ships now <br>here, two or three only excepted.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this precaution will not be disapproved by Your Lordps <br> tho  I have received no  publick  notification of the  warr,  nor any <br>directions either in relation to the Security of the Trade of the defense <br>of the Country: but as tis probable a Governor is now on his way <br>hither, who being a Military man may be better acquainted wth those <br>matters  then  I am, I  shal  fobear troubling Yor Lordps with such <br>things as occurr to me as highly necessary to the Service of both if this <br>war is like to draw out into any considerable length. I am with <br>all possible duty and respect

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Virginia" for the colony in which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence to officials abroad. The county has been added for clarity.
</a><br><br>Established in 1696 as successor to a similar body, the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations was "an advisory group, subordinate to king and Privy Council, and with no executive, financial, or penalizing powers, the Board of Trade was nevertheless able . . . to exert a far reaching and often determining influence in colonial matters. . . . It prepared the royal instructions for the governors overseas. . . ." ( Henry Hartwell, James Blair, and Edward Chilton. Hunter Dickinson Farish, <i>ed.
