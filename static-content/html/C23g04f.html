</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, July 4, 1723, concerning the proprietors' affairs, noting that Perry's account current does not record payments of the rent due to them. He urges Perry to be prompt in payment so that there will be no damage to his reputation. Although he has not had any letters from either William Cage, the trustee, or from Lord Fairfax, to state their reaction to his handling of their affairs in the colony, he will continue to write them yearly. In his concluding paragraph, he informs Perry of his difficulty in obtaining money from Edmund Jenings that is due the proprietors, noting Jenings probably has more debts than resources. He was lucky to obtain some money from Jenings through a mortgage to Mann Page and John Wormeley,  but expects that he will have to file a lawsuit.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a lengthy post script on July 26, 1723, Carter discusses the Jenings' affair further, and then turns to the law suit he is carrying on on the proprietors' behalf regarding their right to certain items set out in the grant itself. The case is before the colony's General Court and his case would be strengthened by specific instructions from Lord Fairfax and Colonel Cage, especially if they would obtain opinions from both the English Attorney General and Solicitor General. He also expects a suit concerning the Brent Town grant. He closes by describing grants made in an area he believes is within the proprietary by then governor Alexander Spotswood that he called to the proprietors' attention during his former period as agent to which they have never responded.
