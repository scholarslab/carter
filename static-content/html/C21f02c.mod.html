</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, Senior, and his grandon of the same name, June 2, 1721, concerning the difficulty that the ships in the colony are having in obtaining cargoes, and that Bailey Kent of the <i>Carter
</i> is finding it difficult to obtain cargo as planters are punishing him for his high freight rates of last year. Carter is sending more tobacco on that ship than he ever has before. Captain Wharton has only about half his cargo, but has said he will not return to Virginia and does not care what anyone thinks of him. He reports the prospects of a poor crop because the young plants are being destroyed in the beds.
