</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, June 27, 1727, concerning tobacco that he had shipped to Stark on the <i>Ann &amp; Elizabeth,
</i> a ship that went aground but whose cargo was saved. He reports a bill of exchange drawn on Stark, encloses a bill of lading (not present) for 34 hogsheads shipped on the <i>Lucia,
</i> and reminds Stark that he expects his tobacco to be sold promptly because he dislikes "Dribling lagg Sales." In a post script, he requests Stark find him several tradesmen. In a post script dated July 22, 1727, he reports others' bills of exchange.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. Rappahannock, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Stark was a  prominent Glasgow merchant in the sugar trade. He served as as baillie and provost (mayor) from 1725-1727. ( John M'ure.  <i>The History of Glasgow.
</i>  [Glasgow: D. Macvean and J. Wyllie &amp; Co., 1830] pp. 227-228
</a> as seen on Google books; and  "Provosts of Glasgow" at <a href="http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/LordProvostsmessage/Provosts+of+Glasgow.htm"target="_wblank">"Welcome to Glasgow"
</a>.
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter had written Stark <a href="C27e19a.html"target="_wblank">May 19, 1727
</a>, "I Sent you in a James River Ship the Ann &amp; Eliza. Mc:Clean Master 13 hhds: of Tobbo: 10 of my own and 3 of Mr. Burwells Estate. I hear the Ship was driven a Shoar in a Storm The Cargoe all Saved and the Ship like to be got of. of this I have yet no Accot: from you."
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.
</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on March 4, 1726, when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."
</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Quit rent was the term used for "a (usually small) rent paid by a freeholder . . .  in lieu of services which might otherwise be required; a nominal rent paid (esp. in former British colonial territories to the Crown) as an acknowledgement of tenure," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online 
</i> 
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] James Read (Reid) is not referred to as "captain" which means he was an official of John Stark's firm on a trading vessel who was empowered to do its business in Virginia. He was aboard the <i>Charles,
</i> a Glasgow ship that was owned by Stark. Carter specifically refers to "Your Ship"and "the Charles of Glasgow" in a <a href="C23i04a.html"target="_wblank">letter to Stark
</a> of September 4, 1723. 
</a><br><br><a name="n6">[6] The <i>Martha
</i>  was commanded by a Captain Dunlop and owned by Richard Oswald &amp; Company; see Carter to Richard Oswald &amp; Company <a href="C29h11a.html"target="_wblank">August 11, 1729,
</a> and Carter to Oswald,  <a href="C31g27b.html"target="_wblank">July 27,1731

</a><br><br><a name="n7"> [7] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n8">[8] John Zuil was a merchant and was probably the ship's captain that Carter mentioned in his diary August 1, 1722, "Zuil Saild Gave me a Bottle Snuff."  Carter recorded a diary note about him the following year as well: December 30, 1723, "mr Zuil &amp; man came back" [from church]. In what British city Zuil lived is not clear, but it may have been Liverpool because city directories of 1767-1773 list a John Zuil as a merchant, first inCable Street, and later, in King Street. This probably would have been a son of the man Carter knew, given the shorter lives at this period. ( <a href="http://www.yulefamily.com/newsletters/yule24.htm">"Yuil Family Newsletters,"

</a><br><br><a name="n9">[9] Henry Lee (1691-1747) was a son of Carter's old friend, Hancock Lee (1653-1709). He lived in Westmoreland County at "Lee Hall" and married Mary Bland. ( Burton J. Hendrick.  <i>The Lees of Virginia: Biography of a Family.
