</i> to make up his cargo before the implementation of the tobacco inspection act, and to send an invoice (not present) for goods to be sent by an early ship.

<br>July 26. 1731<br><br>
Mr. William Dawkins &amp;<br>
Mr. Edward Athawes<br>
 
<br>Gentlemen<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="C31g26b.mod.html#n1"> Captain  Dove
</a> I suppose writes his own story he is riding <br>
about to all our courts and  public  places life a fury and takes <br>
mortal pains to get his men to double their diligence that he may get <br>
a  full  ship before the <a href="C31g26b.mod.html#n2">law takes Place
</a> but I doubt they are too much <br>
like Packhorses to move out of their old <a href="C31g26b.mod.html#n3">Jadish
</a> pace to help him <br>
Foward my sloop  carried  on board him above 80 hogsheads
</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Bailey  being a Backward Ship I have thought <br>
it necessary to send you my invoice now that I may have it in some <br>
forward ship pray let me not wait for the Coming away of  that  Ship any <br>
more  it was  a Considerable disappointment to me the late Coming in of <br>
my goods this year I send for no goods to <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr. Perry
</a> I am well satis <br>
 fied  he will let any of his ships Accommodate  you  And in Point of <br>
 convenience  there is little difference between York River and <a href="C31g26b.mod.html#n4">Ours
</a>
</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will crowd in here a line to Mr. Athawes about our <br>
<a href="C31g26b.mod.html#n5">Frying pan
</a> it  carries  so Poor a prospect does not afford Agreeable <br>
matter for a letter of itself Our work  men
</i> prove such idle lazy fellows <br>
they do Very little service but to eat our Victuals &amp; drink &amp; to Cash our <br>
money feeding us up with empty hopes this one time or other we <br>
are to  do
</i> wonders getting up Very small quantities of Ore and yet every <br>
day a little blowing up the rocks persuade us they shall be at <br>
a body of very good Ore  before  long Loney  carried  off 4 Barrels all that <br>
these miners have  raised  no more they have  barrelled  as yet nor do I <br>
Expect we shall get any more ready for this Shipping there are 67 <br>
Barrels of our old Ore shot loose into the run of the Bailey We shall  before  <br>
long give Mr. Athawes the Entertainment of a <a href="C31g26b.mod.html#n6"> joint  letter
</a> from us. <br>
He will  please  us very much to miss no Opportunity to Advise what we are <br>
to Expect from our last years ore

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  The <i>Bailey
</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove 1730-1732. She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] A jade is a "a horse of inferior breed, e.g. a cart-or draught-horse as opposed to a riding horse; a roadster, a hack; a sorry, ill-conditioned, wearied, or worn-out horse; a vicious, worthless, ill-tempered horse. . . .   (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online

<br><br><a name="n5">[5]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.

<br><br><a name="n7"> [7] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
