</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, March 25, 1724, to report the safe arrival of Captain Watkinson's vessel, the <i>Vine, 
</i>carrying goods Carter had ordered. He is pleased with the accounts Pemberton has sent, and urges him to continue the work to obtain the repeal of the act prohibiting the importation of stemmed tobacco. He intends to send some leaf tobacco to Liverpool if he can get freight.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
