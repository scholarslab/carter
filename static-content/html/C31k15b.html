Mr. William Dawkins<br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is a <a href="C31i10a.html"target="_wblank">copy of mine
</a> by the  Mary Brigga=<br>
ntine  Captain Belcher
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein I send you a <a href="C31k15b.html#n1">bill of Lading
</a> for 20 hhds. of<br>
tobo. They were p'd me for <a href="C31k15b.html#n2">Quitrents
</a> brought home &amp; <a href="C31k15b.html#n3">priz'd
</a> at my own<br>
house I think they are good of the sort you may  pleas  to take your<br>
own way in the sale of it either <a href="C31k15b.html#n4">at the mast
</a> for Export or inland -- 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now under a great puzzle with our <a href="C31k15b.html#n5">tobo law
</a><br>
the weights &amp; Scales are not Come in <a href="C31k15b.html#n6">Mr. Buchanan
</a>  hath  sent some<br>
scatter'd letters signifying that <a href="C31k15b.html#n7">it was  passt 
</a> Warehouses are built &amp;<br>
building in most parts and so are the inspectors Appointed except in<br>
Some of the Upper parts of Our Rivers which we reckon will soon be<br>
Supply'd also --  this good Effect the law  hath  already had that all<br>
people and especially our Overseers are wonderfully alarum'd in the<br>
neat handling of tobacco it occasions the throwing away of  abundance of what<br>
we us'd to get good money for I almost think there will not be more tobacco<br>
to ship this Year it may be not so much by a great deal as was the last<br>
Notwithstanding the great noises of a mighty Crop but I would not have<br>
you take much notice of what I say the best guesses we can make<br>
are very much at random however I  beleive  you may reckon safely<br>
that the tobo which will be  shipt  will in general be the neatest &amp; best hand<br>
led that ever you saw I am

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1"> [1] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.

</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Quit rent was the term used for "a (usually small) rent paid by a freeholder . . .  in lieu of services which might otherwise be required; a nominal rent paid (esp. in former British colonial territories to the Crown) as an acknowledgement of tenure," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. (  <i>Oxford English Dictionary Online
</i> . Oxford University Press.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] To prize is "to compress (cured tobacco) in a hogshead or box." There is a good description of the process on pages 100-101 in Middleton's   <i>Tobacco Coast.

</a> and  Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.

</a>). 
</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] The tobacco inspection act of  1730 was introduced and steered through the legislature by Lieutenant Governor Sir William Gooch. " The "bill called for the inspection and bonding at public warehouses of all tobacco shipped abroad; for the destruction of all unacceptable tobacco; for standardization of the size of hogsheads . . . ; for maintenance of detailed records to prevent smuggling; and for the circulation of warehouse receipts as legal tender in lieu of tobacco iteself. . . ." Gooch also managed to obtain approval of the act in England. It went into effect 1731 August 1.(<a href="Cbibl.html#B27">Billings. <i>et al. 
</i>  <i>Colonial Virginia: A History. 
</i> 
</a> pp. 236-39.)
