</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity. There is a hole in the page that deleted the date, but theletter is found in the letter book between letters of September 30,and October 10, 1720.
