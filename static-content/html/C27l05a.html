</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his son-in-law, Colonel Mann Page, December 5, 1727, concerning the affairs of Nathaniel Burwell's estate, the stroke recently suffered by Nathaniel Harrison whose positions as member of the Council and as auditor general of the colony will become vacant on his death. Carter believes the best person to replace Harrison on the Council will be John Clayton, the attorney general, who is expected back from England at any time. He adds news about his family and their and his health, Charles's trip to the falls, and concludes with affectionate greetings to his daughter and all of Page's "fireside." In a lengthy post script he notes Clayton's arrival and that he soon hopes to hear the results of Clayton's presentation to the House of Lords about the Northern Neck proprietary.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County.

</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3]  "The auditor was unquestionably a royal appointee, and held his commission under the great seal. He was, after 1680, upon the appointment of the auditor-general of the colonies, the deputy of that official. When the auditorship was established, it was stated that only councillors and those who had long resided in the colony were eligible to this office, and it seems that this principle was generally observed. . . . As the name of the office indicates, the auditor examined all the revenue accounts of the colony, except a few purely local ones under the supervision of the treasurer. Among these accounts were those of the royal collectors and naval officers, the quit-rents, the public claims, the fines and forfeitures. He swore to his accounts before the governor and the Council in April and October, and forwarded them through the auditorgeneral to the lords of the treasury. . . . For a few years after the establishment of the office, the auditor received a salary from the Assembly ;18 later, he was paid a salary as a royal official of &pound;100 a year out of the British treasury. His compensation was, however, largely in the form of a fee, which was gradually increased from three to seven and a half per cent of the revenue accounts audited, and amounted to about &pound;400 a year."
