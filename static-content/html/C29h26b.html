<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Robert Cary, August 26, 1729, to inform him of the reduced crops in the colony due to the heavy rains during the summer, and that he is not shipping tobacco because the merchant has not had a ship in the colony. He notes arrangements for financial security for his son Charles's work as naval officer of the Rappahannock.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The London ship  <i>Williamsburgh
</i> was a large vessel of 550 tons and carried a crew of 26 men. Charles Rogers commanded her in 1727-29. ( Admiralty 68/194, and 68/195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Parliament had passed an act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. John Randolph was sent to England in 1728 as agent for Virginia to try to have the act overturned; his mission was successful, and he was home in the colony by <a href="C29f02a.html"target="_wblank">June 2, 1729
</a>, when Carter wrote to welcome him home. ( Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] The naval officer was an official in the colony that reported to the Commissioners of Customs, a body that had first been established in 1663; the group was reorganized several times, especially after 1688. The board was "intrusted with collection of customs both in England and the colonies." The board helped write many of the instructions for colonial governors in collaboration with the Privy Council. "Their direct connection with the colonies was through the governors, who were instructed to correspond with the commissioners, and to send them, every three months, lists of clearances, and also reports of illegal trading. The governor's agent in matters of trade was the naval officer whom he was empowered to appoint, but who was required by the 7th and 8th William III to give security to the commissioners of customs."
