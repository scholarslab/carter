</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, July 4, 1723, concerning his shipments of tobacco on several vessels, and the care that has been taken in the production of the tobacco. He then writes at length about &pound;1,500 that will be returned to him from an annuity with the Bank of England which he urges Perry to hold at 5% interest. Carter notes that he can obtain 6% in Virginia but would prefer Perry to have it. He asks Perry to find out why his Bank of England stock has paid only 6% interest when he had been promised 8% at the time that he bought it. He closes by informing Perry that 7 hogshead of the tobacco that is being shipped he has collected from Essex and Middlesex and prized it at his home; it belongs to his son John and the profit should be transferred to John's account but accounted for to Carter.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.
