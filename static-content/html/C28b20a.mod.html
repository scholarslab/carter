</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] James Christian was captain of the <i>Rose,
</i> a vessel owned by merchant John Pemberton of Liverpool. (See <a href="C30d15a.html"target="_wblank">Carter to Pemberton,
</a> April 15, 1730.)
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Robert Carter's home, "Corotoman," was located on the northeastern bank of the Rapphannock River in Lancaster County close to the present-day community of Weems.  A stream called Corrotoman [<i>sic
</i>] River ran inland west of the house. Carter built a fine house there in the mid 1720s, but it burned in January 1729. See the <a href="http://www.christchurch1735.org/history/corotoman.html"target="_wblank">"Corotoman" page
</a> of the web site of Historic Christ Church Foundation for more information about the house and excavation of its ruins.  ( See the <i>Maryland Gazette
</i> for February 4-11, 1728/29 for comment on Carter's loss. The Maryland Archives has placed its copies of the  <i>Maryland Gazette
</i> online. Unfortunately, page four of the issue of February 4-11, 1728/29 is missing, and that must be where the notice of the fire at Corotoman appeared; the text is quoted in secondary sources as reading: "The fine large house of Colonel Carter on the Rappahannock was also burnt lately. The particulars of his loss we can't give you, but we are inform'd it is very great." [<i>Garden Club of Virginia Journal
</i>, May-June 1983, p.8.])
</a><br><br><a name="n3"> [3] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

He also founded the Delftfield Pottery, Glasgow in l748, of which his brother Robert Dinwiddie (Lieut Governor of Virginia) was a partner."

In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain William Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729.
