</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  Carter, whose Latin was good, here uses the Latin abbreviation "Exon" for "Exoniensis," " the Latin name for the city of Exeter in Devon, England."  Exeter is about twenty-five miles west of Lyme Regis where Burridge lived. ("Exoniensis . . .  is the Latin adjectival form of Exonia, the Latin name for the city of Exeter in Devon, England." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoniensis"target="_wblank">Wikipediaa
</a>.)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] This may be Will Read, captain of an unnamed ship belonging to Nathaniel Gundry that Carter referred to in a letter to John Burridge <a href="C29f26a.html"target="_wblank">June 26, 1729
</a>.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Nathaniel Gundry was a merchant in Lyme Regis, Dorset, and mayor of that town several times. His son was a member of Parliament and later a judge. (Notes made by Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., from   George Robert.  <i>History and Antiquities of the Borough of Lyme Regis &amp; Charnmouth.
</i>  [London, 1834]. pp. 97, 383-4.
</a>; and        <a href="Cbibl.html#B6">Sedgwick.  <i>The History of Parliament . . . Commons.
