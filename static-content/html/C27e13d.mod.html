</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, May 13 and June 2, 1727, compaining about the prices realized in Dawkins' tobacco sales and reporting that he has lost at least 70 slaves. He will call upon his balance in Dawkins' hands for &pound;4-500 in their replacement. A bill of lading (not present) for 20 hogsheads of tobacco is enclosed. Merchant Micajah Perry has been so indifferent to Carter that he is thinking of ending his business with Perry. The problems of the <i>Carter
</i> and her captain, Adam Graves, receive comment. In a post script, Carter writes that he has learned of the failure of London merchant Thomas Evans who owes him about &pound;400 but that he understands that there is very little money available to pay Evans' creditors.
