<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Edward Athawes, June 28, 1729, to point out to Athawes that neither he nor his partner, William Dawkins, has bothered to confirm to Carter that partnership. He notes that he has sent more tobacco to their firm than to any other and states what he expects from a merchant who handles his business.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
