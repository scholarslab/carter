</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br>The several words in italics were additions Carter made to the clerk's draft. It is interesting that he should be ordering from Evans as he knew that Evans' business had failed; he commented on it in a <a href="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/C27e13d.html"target="_wblank">letter to William Dawkins
</a> (May 13, 1727) that he had written a few days earlier.
