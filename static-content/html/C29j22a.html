<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to a senior manager, Robert Jones of Prince William County, October 22, 1729, to give him very specific instructions about the distribution of bedding, caps, and clothes for slaves on the quarters under his supervision, the breaking and training  of oxen for carts for which wheels and other gear are being sent, rounding up of hogs, cider, beef, and butter for Carter's use, and to chide Jones for his inattention to Carter's affairs.

</a> for <br>
Grace my son <a href="Cbiodir.html#CC1">Charles
</a> is very Certain that he sent one before for her knowing <br>
her to be a large Woman &amp; Cowkeeper he was particularly  Carefull  to choose <br>
a  pettyCt  for her and set her name Upon it and it was one of the  PettyCts  <br>
that the things were sow'd up in, I hope you will <sup><font color="green">be
</i>
</font>
</sup> more  Carefull  in the right <br>
delivery of these goods than you were in the  Cloths,  for what I Observ'd <br>
you never so much as Look'd into the Packs to see whether Everything was <br>
there <sup><font color="green">before
</i>
</font>
</sup> you sent them away so that it is in the breast of any Overseer <br>
to take What they  pleas  out and deny that they Came to them this is like <br>
the rest of the care you Use about Other things, the way us'd to be Either <br>
to have all the People down from the Several Qrs and fit them at the <br>
<a href="Cbiodir.html#FQ">Falls Qr:
</a> or Else to have the furthest overseers down and to open <br>
the packs before them and let them see that Every thing was right for <br>
their Gangs, this is the method I observe with <a href="Cbiodir.html#NH2">Nomini
</a> and Richland <br>
people every Overseer comes down for his peoples  Cloths  and sees <br>
that everything is right and this is the method that I Will have Observ'd <br>
By the person that lives in your Station
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sent you two pr of  Wheals  with <a href="C29j22a.html#n2"> Axtrees

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have agreed with an Overseer for Richland And have oblig'd <br>
him in his Conditions to Break me a Yoke of Oxen, he will Be up <br>

Yokes &amp; Chains &amp;ca. one for <a href="C29j22a.html#n8">Oxford
</a> and Mountain the Other for <br>
Richland, the two first  teems  I would hope if you were a person <br>
of life &amp; resolution would be soon got ready for your use and <br>
While the Other are getting ready for you you might Break more <br>
young Oxen that might be ready for the two Carts that I intend <br>
to provide Wheels for by the next Sloop When we get these 5  teems  <br>
of Oxen  Equipt  and Well managed I think all business will go <br>
on with a great deal of Ease And Wheat &amp; Corn &amp;ca. will be Easily <br>
brought down  <S><font color="red">without

</S>  and  removd  from one plantation to ano<br>
ther without The sad  specticle  of Sore  backt  horses &amp; poor <a href="C29j22a.html#n9">Jades

their fencing stuff drawn into place their Firewood got to <br>

Upon it purposely for my Own drinking therefore you <br>

that there the  Cyder  be drawn of from the <a href="C29j22a.html#n10">Lees
