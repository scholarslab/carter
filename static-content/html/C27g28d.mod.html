</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Captain Charles Lee and Thomas Berry, Churchwardens of Wiccomco Parish, Northumberland County, July 28, 1727, to clear up any misgiving that they may have had concerning the application of Reverend Thomas Bailey to be their minister. Carter lays out the circumstances of Bailey's departure from his last Virginia parish, his low wages in North Carolina, his qualifications as deacon and priest, and notes that Bailey asks only to be on probation until the arrival of the governor.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Thomas Baylie (Bayley, Bailey, b. 1683?) was one of the most notorious colonial Virginia clergymen. Commissary Blair had written to the bishop of London in 1724, "We have at present two Ministers (Mr. Thomas Baylie and . . . ) so very scandalous for drunkenness and fighting and Quarreling in their drink that many grevious complaints are brought to me against them, and indeed the Country rings of the scandal given by them." Baylie was the minister at that time of Newport Parish, Isle of Wight County. The parish determined to get rid of Baylie, and in 1725, brought an agreement to the Governor and Council by which Baylie agreed to relinquish his ministry and leave the colony; he disputed the amount of salary he was to receive and was awarded the full year.
