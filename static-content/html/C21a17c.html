His first five years in thecolony were fairly successful ones, but  his policies concerning landquitrents and over the colonial church brought confrontation withpowerful members of the Council. Their interests in England led toSpotswood's dismissal as governor in 1722. He had acquired large landholdings, and he went to England in 1724 where he married and workedon securing the titles to his Virginia land holdings. In 1730 hereturned to Virginia and remained there.
