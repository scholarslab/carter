</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to William Cage, trustee of  Lady Fairfax's estate, July 4, 1723, concerning the debts owed by the former agent of the Northern Neck proprietary in the colony, Edmund Jenings, to the proprietors. Carter believes he has collected all that is possible and that the next alternative is to file a suit. He notes that Jenings is in very poor physical and financial health. He then turns to the problem of establishing the boundaries of the Brent Town grant within the proprietary and reports that George Brent and his mother have sworn they will not permit Carter to survey it. He adds that he always reminds Micajah Perry when writing him to have the rent money ready for Cage but hopes Cage will not call for it sooner than it is needed. In a lengthy poost script dated July 22, 1723, Carter reports the steps he has taken in the colony to force the authorities to recognize the rights of the proprietors to certain types of property. His case is to be heard by the General Court, and he asks Cage to obtain legal opinions in England that would support Carter's Virginia lawyers.

</u> <br>Wm Cage Esqr. --  -- <br> <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although   you have not been pleased to let me have <br>a line from you in some Years, I must not  omit   to let you <br>hear from me Especially how your Affair with <a href="Cbiodir.html#EJ"> Colonel     Jenings  
</a> <br>Stands,  it was   a lucky chance I had to  get
</i> so much of your debt from <br>him last Year, but I  can't   get a penny more from him, I have <br> lately   got an Accot: Settled under his hand a  copy   of which <br>I now send you also a  copy   of part of a Letter  of yours to  -- <br>Edmund  Jenings   whereby he reckons to discharge himself of <br>a   [<i>sic
</i>]
</i> Above a hundred pound of his debt, he  has   no other Voucher <br>to do it by, and I must observe to you that both the Letter and <br>the name seems to be all of your own hand  writing  , wherein <br>your Demand was but for two Years rent, so that he reckons --  <br>that you  received   of Mr. Adamson on his Accot: more Money  than   <br>he can make appear from any of the Accots: he has to show <br>from Adamson, It will  be
</i> proper for you to consider of this --  <br>Matter and let me know your thoughts of it --  -- 
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have his repeated promises that he will dispose <br>of some of his Virginia Estate to raise money for you, these <br>are but words, I take his Circumstances to be very Desperate <br>and he is a very decayed man, so that I am of Opinion the <br>Safest way is to bring  <S><font color="red">a
</font>
</S>  Suit against him which I am not very <br>willing to do  until   you send me your positive Orders to  justify   <br>me in going into these harsh measures with him
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall find a great deal of Difficulty in the <br>laying Off the <a href="Cbiodir.html#BT">Brenton Grant,
</a> I have given some  public   <br>Notice about, <a href="C23g04a.mod.html#n1">Young Brent
</a>  and his Mother declare <br>if I Offer to Stretch a chain there they will Stop me, I <br>must try whether they will be as good as their words, If <br>they do I shall go near to call them before their betters, <br>I hope your money upon my Lease is punctually paid <br>you, I hardly write a Letter to Mr. Perry but I <br>press him to pay your rents at the Succeeding Year it <br>is due, last winter he tells me your money was ready <br>for you at your call --  -- <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</u><br><br>When I  wrote   the above  it was   out of my head to let <br>you know that I had a  controversy   with the Crown about <br>the meaning of some words in the Proprietors Grant to wit <br>this Clause (All and all manner of Deodands goods of <br>"felons and fugitives Treasure Trove waifs Strays fines <br>"forfietures Escheats advowsons Royalltys and Heridita <br>"whatsoever) Notwithstanding these strong words all  Colonel   <br> Jenings   time the Deodands have been taken by the <br>Governour the felons=goods, and the fines and forfietures <br>have been  received   by the Officers of the Crown and Accounted <br>for to the Revenue, Soon after I  received   your power of <br>Attorney I asserted  <S><font color="red">our

Graves | &amp; delivd to his own hand | Per the Carter." There is a note on the address leaf: "BG to Inclose this as directed. &amp; desire | an answer as to the receipt of it by the | Generall Post." The letter is endorsed by Cage,  "July 4, 1723."
