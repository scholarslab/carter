</center><br><br><i>Source copy consulted: 
</i>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparentlythere was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- nowlost -- from which the unknown copyist recorded these texts. Asthey are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections" obviouslysupplied by the copyist have been retained. 
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The return address, county, and colony have beenadded for clarity to this unheaded letter.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] The reports of a siege of Gibraltar werewrong.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter's sons Robert (1704-1732) and Charles (1706-1764) were on board the <i>Carter
</i> on their wayto England for their further education. As the letter of July 26,1718, from Dawkins to Carter shows, they had arrived safely.
