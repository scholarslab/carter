</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter refers to the scandal of the value of thestock of the South Sea and other companies which wild speculation haddriven enormously high in June 1720, and which was nearly worthlessseveral months later. Many fortunes were made and lost. Perhaps themost succesful speculator was Sir Robert Walpole who made a fortune,retired, and then was called to save the nation as prime minister, apost he held from 1721 until 1742. ( Goldwin Smith. <i>A History of England.
</i>  Chicago, etc.: Scribner's, 1949.pp. 422-424.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Sweetscentedtobacco was one of two major types grown in Carter's day. It was mildcompared to the stronger oronocco. Sweetscented required "a typer ofsoil of limited distribution" and "was largely confined to the banksof the great rivers, the James, York, Rappahannock, and Potomac."( Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  AMaritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.
