</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his manager Robert Jones, April 16, 1728, regretting the bad news he seems always to receive from Jones, and complaining about the harsh treatment that some of the overseers have giiven his "people" that he is sure led to unnecessary deaths. He notifies Jones of the  experienced slaves and indentured servants that he is sending.
