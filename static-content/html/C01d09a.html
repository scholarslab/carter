<br><br>The clerk who copied this document into the court order book used many abbreviations which have been expanded for the modern language version of this text. He also used a convention of the time of abbreviating a word and placing a horizontal line over it, or curling back the tail of the last stroke over it, to indicate that the word was to be expanded. Words with these conventions have been expanded silently in these transcript versions as there is no way of depicting such conventions in this software. The clerk also used the "fancy p" at the beginning of a word to stand for "per," "par," or "pro" as appropriate, and these uses have also been silently expanded.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] William Armistead (1671-1711) was born in Gloucester County and lived at "Hesse." His older sister, Judith, was Robert Carter's first wife. He married Anna, Daughter of Hancock Lee, Lee about 1693. ( <xref to="www.surnames.com/jamesriver/descendants/william_armistead/default.htm">"William Armistead"

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Elizabeth (Landon) Willis (1684-1719) was Carter's second wife by whom he had ten children. She had their last child, George, in 1718. See Smith  pp. 1-4 for a discussion of the background of the Landon family in England and Virginia, and of Betty's first marriage to Richard Willis.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] (1656-1701)  Darrett and Anita Rutman write of Richard Willis's position in the  power structure (justice, militia officer) of Middlesex County, and his growing wealth. "Just before his death in 1700 . . . [he] abandoned his old house of four rooms for one of six that also had a separate kitchen and dairy." As Willis married his third wife, <a href="Cbiodir.html#EWC">Betty Landon
</a> (1684-1719) shortly before, he probably anticipated bringing his bride to a fine new establishment. ( "Tithables of Lancaster County, 1654.  <i>Virginia Magazine of History and Biography.

<br><br><a name="n4">[4]   Jennifer Drobac has written, "Simply defined, a jointure 'was a property provision for [the] wife, made prior to marriage in lieu of dower." Henry Black, author of the standard law dictionary, defined dower as "the provision which the law makes for a widow out of the lands or tenements of her husband for her support."' In a review of Susan Staves's  <i>Married Women's Separate Property in England 1660-1833
</i> , Margaret A. Doody wrote: "In the older system that prevailed before the mid-seventeenth century, women had 'dower rights.' At common law, a widow was entitled to a life estate amounting to one-third of all the real property of which her husband had been the legal owner. Staves shows how such a provision came to be felt an unreasonable clog on an estate . . . The result was the invention of the 'jointure,' a settlement upon the wife if her husband predeceased her, as agreed upon in advance by prenuptial contract." (Jennifer Drobac. "The 'Perfect' Jointure: Its Formulation After the Statute of Uses."  19 <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/camblr19&div=6&g_sent=1&collection=journals"target="_wblank"> <i>Cambrian Law Review.
