<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to the governor of the Colony, the Earl of Orkney, August 8, 1728, to send a bill of exchange for the governor's final portion of the fees collected during Carter's administration as acting lieutenant governor. He also requests an additional letter of recommendation for his son. In a post script dated August 28th, Carter responds to  a letter just received from Orkney from which he has learned that William Dawkins apparently has refused to honor a bill of exchange sent by Carter's son.

Two days ago I  received   the  Honor  of your<br>  Lordship's   kind letter

</a> is very  Shocking   <S><font color="red">to me
</font>
</S>  It would be vanity <br>to tell your  Lordship  how much that person is in my Debt, and <br>by my  Endorsement  that bill was my own and well as the other <br>&amp; in respect to my Son, I have a great deal of reason to Conclude he had no Occa=<br>sion to treat his bill with so much disrespect he is a peevish  Gentleman  and parts with  our <br>money with as much reluctance as if it were his own, All that I shall add I think <br>he  <S><font color="red">[illegible]
</font>
</S>   would not be so inconsiderate
</i> to Suffer that bill to be protested I  beg  your   Lordship  not to Entertain <br>any harsh thoughts of my Son on this Account  I am as before

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:

</b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. There is a 19th-century transcript of the letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. The leaf bearing this letter has suffered some marginal damage. The post script was written into the letter book beside and below the complimentary close of the letter itself.
</a>

<br><br>A different clerk as entered the words "to be Copyd" at the head of the letter as is indicated by the use of italics.
</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

<br><br><a name="n1"> [1] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.
