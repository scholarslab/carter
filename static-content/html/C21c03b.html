</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his son, John Carter, March 3, 1721, in England noting that his anger at William Dawkins over Dawkins' impertinence and rudeness has cooled, perhaps from his recent gout attack. He asks John (indirectly) to see Dawkins, and if Dawkins has also cooled off, then John is not to relieve Dawkins of the care of John's younger brothers (also in England at school). Carter praises Dawkins as a good businessman in the trade which only has a few good merchants, and continues that he needs to deal with Dawkins because his affairs are too large to entrust to the Perrys alone. He concludes that he does expect respect from those to whom he gives his business.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><br>The controversy between Carter and William Dawkins spread over some months in 1720-1721. Carter had written before to Dawkins in terms similar to those used in this letter; see his letter to Dawkins of <a href="C20g13d.html"target="_wblank">13 July 1720.
</a> Dawkins had begun his career as an apprentice in the Bailey mercantile firm as Carter notes in this letter. After the death of Arthur Bailey, Jr., he succeeded to the firm into which he brought <a href="Cbiodir.html#EA">Edward Athawes
</a> with whom Carter would also correspond, as would his sons after his death.
</a><br><br><br><a name="n1">[1] The word "everyone" written between the lines is probably in Carter's hand, but makes little sense in context.
