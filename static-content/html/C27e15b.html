</a>
</h3>
</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to [William Robertson,] May 15, 1727, clerk of the Council, to alert him that he had not signed, as naval officer, one of his lists of shipping, and to give him instructions about the celebration of the King's birthday. He encloses a letter to be forwarded to his son John, secretary of state of the colony, whom he is asking to stand in for himself because his ill health will not allow him to attend. In an enclosure, he gives further and specific instructions about the illumination of Williamsburg and details of the celebration.

</a>[1] Robertson had been appointed a naval officer in 1719, and Carter refers to lists of ships entering and departing the colony prepared by these officials as one of their duties. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B10">McIlwaine.  <i>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .

</a><br><br>The naval officer was an official in the colony that reported to the Commissioners of Customs, a body that had first been established in 1663; the group was reorganized several times, especially after 1688. The board was "intrusted with collection of customs both in England and the colonies." The board helped write many of the instructions for colonial governors in collaboration with the Privy Council. "Their direct connection with the colonies was through the governors, who were instructed to correspond with the commissioners, and to send them, every three months, lists of clearances, and also reports of illegal trading. The governor's agent in matters of trade was the naval officer whom he was empowered to appoint, but who was required by the 7th and 8th William III to give security to the commissioners of customs."
