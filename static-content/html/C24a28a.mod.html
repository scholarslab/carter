</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, January 28, 1724, to report the arrival of a number of ships in the colony and his plans for shipping tobacco. He reminds Dawkins of the clothes he has ordered for his son Robin who had returned from England with no hats or shoes, especially winter shoes. He then writes at length about the text books that he wishes his son Landon to study while at Mr. Low's school, praising "Lillie's grammer" and Comenius'  <i>Jannua Linguarum Trilinguis. 
</i> If Mr. Low cannot make Landon "a perfect Master of this Book in all the three Languages," then he will probably remove Landon to Eton where his grandson, Lewis Burwell, is a student.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

</a><br><br><a name="n7">[7] Robert Carter (1704-1732) was Carter's seventh child by hissecond wife, Elizabeth Landon (Willis) Carter. Robert was sent to England to school in 1718; see Carter's letter to William Dawkins, July 9, 1718. Robert married Priscilla Churchill in 1725 and had two children, one of whom, Robert Carter III, would be known as "Councillor" Carter of "Nomini Hall." Robert Carter II died a few months before his father. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B32">Morton.  <i>Robert Robert Carter of Nomini Hall.

Landon would live at "Sabine Hall," Richmond County, and marry three times, leaving many descendants, some of whom own "Sabine Hall" today. As an adult, he would keep a very interesting and useful diary. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B30">Greene.  <i>The Diary of Colonel Landon Carter. . . .

</a><br><br><a name="n9">[9] Mr. Low was Carter's sons' schoolmaster.
</a><br><br><a name="n10">[10] Carter refers to William Lilly (1468?-1522) who "contributed a short Latin syntax, with the rules in English, to the Latin grammar by Colet and Erasmus, c. 1509. This, with another grammar, was the basis of the work known as Lily's Grammar which was long familiar to English schoolboys." It was, by Henry VIII, in 1540 imposed throughout the kingdom as the standard Latin text book. No copy of Lilly is listed in Carter's inventory, but there is a general entry for "7 grammers" that might have included Lilly. (<i>The Oxford Companion to English Literature.

</a><br><br><a name="n11">[11] No copy of Comenius's work appears in the inventory of Carter's library. A typical edition that Carter might have used would be: Johann Amos  Comenius (1592-1670), <i>Janua Linguarum Trilinguis, Sive, Johannis-Amos-Comenii Janua  Linguarum: Novissime ab Ipso Authore Recognita, Aucta, Emendata: Adjunctis Metaphrasi Graeca et Anglicana Versione.

It was founded by Henry VI in 1440-41 for 70 highly qualified boys who received scholarships from a fund endowed by the king. Simultaneously, Henry founded King's College, Cambridge, to which scholars from Eton were to proceed. That connection is no longer in place." ("Eton College," from the <i>Encyclopedia Brittanica
